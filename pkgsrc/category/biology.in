	  of support to each internal branch.  PUZZLE also computes pairwise
	  maximum likelihood distances as well as branch lengths for user

	  clock-assumption.  In addition, PUZZLE offers a novel method,
	  likelihood mapping, to investigate the support of a hypothesized
	  internal branch without computing an overall tree and to
	  visualize the phylogenetic content of a sequence alignment.
	  PUZZLE also conducts a number of statistical tests on the data
	  set (chi-square test for homogeneity of base composition,
	  likelihood ratio to test the clock hypothesis, Kishino-Hasegaw a
	  test).  The models of substitution provided by PUZZLE are TN, HKY,
	  F84, SH for nucleotides, Dayhoff, JTT, mtREV24, BLOSUM 62 for
