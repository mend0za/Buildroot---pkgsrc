	  to an administrator for distribution.  efax can also pass incoming
	  data calls to a getty program.
	  
	  The efax package includes ``efix,'' a program to convert between
	  various image file formats.  To fax Postscript files you will need
	  Ghostscript.  To view faxes you can use any program that displays PGM
	  files.  efix can convert received files to Postscript or HP Laserjet
