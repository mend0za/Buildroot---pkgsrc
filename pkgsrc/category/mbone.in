	  Distributed IPv4/IPv6 multicast beacon

	  dbeacon is a Multicast Beacon written in C++. The main purpose of
	  a beacon is to monitor other beacon's reachability and collect
	  statistics such as loss, delay and jitter between beacons. dbeacon
	  supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast, collecting information via
	  ASM and SSM.
	  
	  dbeacon was originally only IPv6 capable, designed to be used in
	  the m6bone.

	  Multicast file distribution tool

	  mdd stands for multicast data dump. It was designed for distributing
	  a file using multicast. The primary goal was to replicate a hard disk
	  image on all the workstations of a computer room at the same time.
	  
	  The protocol used is rather simple and will not make any effort to avoid
	  flooding your network. IGMP-snooping enabled switches are advised.
	  
	  WARNING: this tool is designed to operate on a private LAN where no
	  congestion occurs. It has no rate limiting feature, which makes it
	  unsuitable for use on the Internet. Do not try to use it outside of
	  a private LAN, it will attempt to eat all your bandwidth to flood the
	  multicast group you send data to.

	  Multicast file transfer

	  The Multicast Dissemination Protocol (MDP) is a protocol framework and
	  software toolkit for reliable multicasting data objects.  A primary
	  design goal of MDP is to provide a reliable multicast protocol approach
	  which is suitable for reliable dissemination of data over both wireless
	  and wired networks.
	  
	  MDP software has been demonstrated across a range of network architecture
	  and heterogeneous conditions including; the worldwide Internet MBone,
	  bandwidth and routing asymmetric network connections, high delay satellite
	  networks, and mobile, radio networks.  MDP version 2, the latest software
	  release and ongoing work, integrates numerous multicast protocol advances
	  including highly robust, packet-based erasure correction techniques and
	  adaptive group timing mechanisms.
	  
	  The present MDPv2 software release has a defined API library and several
	  example working applications including a multicast file transfer applications
	  and a very basic multicast chat application. To learn more and/or download
	  the software see the following sections.
