	  available, Xft uses the Render extension to accelerate text drawing.
	  When Render is not available, Xft uses the core protocol to draw
	  client-side glyphs. This provides completely compatible support of

	  Xft (2.0) hides most of the underlying system details so that developers

	  is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
	  attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
	  in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001),
	  TDC2003 (2003).
	  
	  Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
	  additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
	  the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
	  attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
	  including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
	  ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):
	  
	  Range           Description
	  U+0020-U+007F   Basic Latin
	  U+00A0-U+00FF   Latin-1 Supplement

	  U+2100-U+214F   Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)
	  
	  Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early

	  Free TrueType fonts from Bitstream, useful for web viewing

	  This package installs two free TrueType fonts, they are useful for web viewing.
	  
	  The typeface is Geometric Slabserif 703, which is Bitstream's version of
	  Memphis  a typeface designed in 1930 by Rudolph Weiss. While it may seem odd
	  that a typeface designed 65 years ago would look good on-screen today,
	  the reason has to do with the shape of the letterforms themselves.
	  
	  They have a simple, geometric shape, and their serifs (the small protrusions
	  from the ends of the letter) are in the "slab" family, which means they, too,
	  are simple. The "x-height" (the height of the lowercase letter "x") is
	  relatively large, but not so large that it makes reading difficult in the web
	  where there is little real control over leading (the space between the lines).
	  
	  Bitstream is supplying these typefaces to help you see the importance of type
	  on the web. Once you see how different web pages can look just by changing the
	  typeface, and how much easier they can be to read, you'll see the importance of
	  typographic choice on the web.

	  Library for generating bitmaps from Adobe Type 1 fonts

	  bitmaps from Adobe Type 1 fonts. It uses most internal parts of the Type 1
	  rasterizer provided with X11R5 and newer but tries avoid the disadvantages
	  known from that rasterizer. Although most people would use the rasterizer
	  under X11, having X11 is not necessary at all.
	  
	  The rasterizer is implemented as a shared or static library to be linked
	  to the programs that want to use Type 1 fonts. In addition to this library
	  there is a test-program called xglyph which, as the name indicates,
	  requires X11. It can be used to show most of the features of the library.
