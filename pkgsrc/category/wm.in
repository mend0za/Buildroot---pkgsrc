	  8 1/2-like Window Manager for X

	  9wm Version 1.1
	  Copyright 1994 David Hogan.
	  
	  What is 9wm?
	  ============
	  
	  9wm is an X window manager which attempts to emulate the Plan 9 window
	  manager 8-1/2 as far as possible within the constraints imposed by X.
	  It provides a simple yet comfortable user interface, without garish
	  decorations or title-bars. Or icons.  And it's click-to-type.  This
	  will not appeal to everybody, but if you're not put off yet then read
	  on.  (And don't knock it until you've tried it).
	  
	  One major difference between 9wm and 8-1/2 is that the latter provides
	  windows of text with a typescript interface, and doesn't need to run a
	  separate program to emulate a terminal.  9wm, as an X window manager,
	  does require a separate program.  For better 8-1/2 emulation, you should
	  obtain Matthew Farrow's "9term" program (ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/matty/unicode),
	  version 1.6 or later (earlier versions don't cooperate with 9wm in
	  implementing "hold mode").  Of course, you can run xterm under 9wm as well.

	  In tiled layout windows are managed in a master and stacking area.
	  The master area contains the window which currently needs most

	  In monocle layout all windows are maximised to the screen size. In
	  floating layout windows can be resized and moved freely.
	  
	  Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or
	  multiple tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with
	  these tags.
	  
	  Each screen contains a small status bar which displays all available
	  tags, the layout, the number of visible windows, the title of the

	  if the screen is focused.

	  An alternative user-interface technique is "pie" menus -

	  Simple dynamic window manager for X

	  A simple dynamic window manager for X, with features nicked from
	  ratpoison and dwm:
	  
	  * Musca operates as a tiling window manager by default. It uses
	  manual tiling, which means the user determines how the screen is
	  divided into non-overlapping frames, with no restrictions on
	  layout.  Application windows always fill their assigned frame,
	  with the exception of transient windows and popup dialog boxes
	  which float above their parent application at the appropriate
	  size.  Once visible, applications do not change frames unless
	  so instructed.
	  * Since not all applications suit tiling, a more traditional
	  stacking window manager mode is also available, allowing windows
	  to float at any screen location and overlap.
	  * There are no built in status bars, panels, tabs or window
	  decorations to take up screen real estate. If the user wants
	  any of these things, there are plenty of external applications
	  available to do the job. Window decoration is limited to a
	  slender border, which is coloured to indicate keyboard focus.
	  * Windows are placed in named groups which can be used in a
	  similar fashion to virtual desktops. Groups can be added and
	  removed on the fly, and each group has its own frame layout.
	  * The excellent dmenu utility is used to execute commands and
	  launch applications, and it can also act as a window and group
	  switcher. Basic EWMH support allows use of common panels, pagers
	  and wmctrl.
	  * Windows and frames are navigated and focused on any mouse button
	  click, including rolling the wheel, or alternatively driven
	  entirely by the keyboard. Simple key combinations exist for
	  window switching, group switching, frame control and screen
	  switching.
	  * Frames can be dedicated to a single application window, preventing
	  new windows usurping said frame. One frame per group can also
	  be flagged as a catch-all so that all new application windows
	  open there. The frame border colour changes to reflect these
	  modes.
	  * Musca has multi-screen support out of the box, and will
	  automatically create groups for every available screen.

	  that may be achieved through separate applications.
	  
	  All high-level wm functions are implemented in Lisp for future

	  used for much more important stuff. It has sane defaults and does
	  not require one to learn a language to do any configuration. It
	  was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small,
	  compact and fast.
	  
	  It was largely inspired by xmonad and dwm. Both are fine products
	  but suffer from things like: crazy-unportable-language-syndrome,
	  silly defaults, asymmetrical window layout, "how hard can it be?"
	  and good old NIH. Nevertheless dwm was a phenomenal resource and
	  many good ideas and code was borrowed from it. On the other hand
	  xmonad has great defaults, key bindings and xinerama support but
	  is crippled by not being written in C.
	  
	  Scrotwm is a beautiful pearl! For it too, was created by grinding
	  irritation. Nothing is a bigger waste of time than moving windows
	  around until they are the right size-ish or having just about any
	  relevant key combination being eaten for some task one never needs.
	  The path of agony is too long to quote and in classical OpenBSD
	  fashion (put up, or hack up) a brand new window manager was whooped

	  described in more detail in README.old, was added by Tom LaStrange himself.
	  Since then, tvtwm has fallen under my control, and I've added some things
	  myself.
	  
	  Why doesn't tvtwm have version numbers, and only has patchlevels?  I
	  don't know.  History, I suppose.  But, for information's sake, that is
	  effectually the version number.  In this case, pl11.
	  
	  The major benefit of tvtwm over twm is the "Virtual Desktop".  This
	  allows you do define a substitute root window that is larger than your
	  display area.  This new virtual root window is the parent for all of your
	  X clients.  tvtwm provides a "Panner" which will let you see a scaled down
	  representation of the whole virtual desktop.  Using this panner, and keys
	  bound to functions added to tvtwm, you can move around this desktop to
	  have your physical display showing only part of the whole desktop.  Thus,
	  you can have sections of your desktop assigned to particular tasks, or
	  just use it to keep from having 20 million layers of windows.  :-)
	  
	  Many other things are discussed in README.old.  Please look there for

	  covering the whole screen and a terminal to use Lynx and browse the
	  web ;-)) provided that you do not have a large number of windows on
	  your screen.  But in some occasions it is not the case (ie. you have
	  to telnet to 4-5 remote machines), which is painful with 9wm.
	  
	  This need for virtual screens motivated this about 50 lines hack.
	  w9wm brings support for virtual screens (provided you use the second
	  button, aka middle button to select one virtual screen) as well as for
	  key bindings (to switch from one window to another).

	  Fast and highly customizable virtual window manager

	  The design goal for waimea is to create the most efficient desktop
	  working environment available. To achieve this, waimea is a fast and
	  highly customizable virtual desktop window manager. It uses the blackbox
	  image rendering engine (blackbox styles support) and can use the Xft
	  library for font rendering (anti-aliased font support). It also features
	  a very advanced configuration system with which is possible to make waimea
	  behave as almost any other window manager.

	  Minimalist window manager for X

	  wm2 -- a window manager
	  =======================
	  
	  wm2 is a window manager for X.  It provides an unusual style of window
	  decoration and as little functionality as I feel comfortable with in a
	  window manager.  wm2 is not configurable, except by editing the source
	  and recompiling the code, and is really intended for people who don't
	  particularly want their window manager to be too friendly.
	  
	  wm2 provides:
	  
	  -- Decorative frames for your windows.
	  
	  -- The ability to move, resize, hide and restore windows.
	  
	  -- No icons.
	  
	  -- No configurable root menus, buttons or mouse or keyboard bindings.
	  
	  -- No virtual desktop, toolbars or integrated applications.

	  Another X11 window manager based on wm2, with GNOME compliance

	  wmx is another window manager for X.  It is based on wm2 and provides
	  a similarly unusual style of window decoration; but in place of wm2's
	  minimal functionality, it offers many of the features of more
	  conventional managers in the most simplistic implementations
	  imaginable.  wmx is, however, still barely configurable except by
	  editing the source and recompiling the code.
	  
	  This package is built with GNOME compliance.

	  Command line interface to an EWMH-compliant WM

	  wmctrl is a command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM compatible X
	  Window Manager.
	  
	  It provides command line access to almost all the features defined in the EWMH
	  specification.  Using it, it's possible to, for example, obtain information
	  about the window manager, get a detailed list of desktops and managed windows,
	  switch and resize desktops, change number of desktops, make windows
	  full-screen, always-above or sticky, and activate, close, move, resize,
	  maximize and minimize them.
	  
	  The command line access makes it easy to automate these tasks and execute them
	  from any application that is able to run a command in response to some event.

	  Minimalist, flexible and highly customizable window manager

	  WMI is a new window manager for X11, which combines the best features of
	  LarsWM, Ion, TrsWM, evilwm and ratpoison into one window manager.
	  
	  WMI is new: it is developed from scratch with C++ without any ancient code
	  and design dependencies to antiquated window managers.
	  
	  WMI is minimalist: it has no build- or runtime dependencies except the C++
	  Standard Template Library (STL) and the X11 Library (XLib).
	  
	  WMI is highly customizable: it is designed with keyboard users in mind. Each
	  action (e.g. resizing the frame, creating a new workspace, launching an app,
	  note that WMI provides hundreds of actions) can be bind to a shortcut. So say
	  good-bye to the rodent :)

	  Features include:
	  * Built in multi-monitor support (using Xinerama)
