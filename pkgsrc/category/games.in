	  KiSS is an acronym for Kisekae Set System. "Kisekae" is a Japanese word
	  used in reference to changing clothes. "Kisekae ningyo" is the Japanese
	  term for what we call in America a "fashion doll" (such as Barbie).
	  
	  In 1991, a Japanese computer programmer known as MIO.H released a
	  viewing platform and related image archives, or "kisekae sets",
	  specifically designed to bring the "fashion doll" concept into the
	  digital world. The result is something of a cross between a paper doll
	  and a computer game. With the appropriate viewer for their operating
	  system, a computer user could download various doll "sets" and play with
	  them on their desktop.  The Kisekae Set System, or KiSS, was originally
	  inspired by the dress-up games young girls play with fashion dolls. The
	  KiSS computer game found a much broader audience, and today there are
	  KiSS sets for every age, taste and orientation. Some KiSS sets weren't
	  even dolls--there were puzzles, board games, maps, even virtual models
	  like the Space Cruiser Yamato. These came to be called "Aberrant KiSS"
	  to distinguish them from the regular doll sets.

	  relatively easy. The current version supports all of "Ultima 7:
	  The Black Gate" and "Ultima 7 part 2: The Serpent Isle", allowing

	  done by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima 7 data files,
	  especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter
	  Dijkslag.
	  
	  Exult aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993)

	  surpassing) its original splendor as is possible. You need to own
	  "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" and/or "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle" and

	  GNOME program for playing the game Amazons

	  Amazons is a game played on a 10x10 chess board. Each side has four
	  pieces (amazons) that move like chess queens (in a straight line
	  in any direction). Instead of capturing pieces like in chess, the
	  game is determined based on who moves last.
	  
	  Each move consists of two parts. First an amazon moves to a new
	  square and then fires an arrow to another square (the arrow is
	  fired in a straight line in any direction from the square the amazon
	  landed on). The square the arrow lands on becomes a permenant block
	  for the rest of the game. No one can move over it, or fire an arrow
	  over it. Every turn an amazon must move and fire an arrow, so every
	  turn there is one less square available on the board. Try and block
	  in your opponent or section off a good chunk of the board for
	  yourself.

	  overwhelm the opponent with strategic turret and fighter placements.
	  However, only those who truly understand the intricate details of
	  both action and strategy will win the day.
	  
	  Because alliances can be broken on a whim, players must interpret
	  the social situation of the game to ensure that each alliance is

	  plant turrets and fighters within your base only to break the

	  Gate 88 employs a unique user interface that allows players to

	  Chess engine with 3D OpenGL-rendered chessboard

	  KnightCap is a chess program written for the Fujitsu AP1000+ parallel
	  computer (running AP/Linux).
	  
	  The principal differences between KnightCap and other chess programs
	  are:
	  - KnightCap has an optional fully rendered 3D interface, giving a feel
	  much more like an "over the board" game.
	  - KnightCap was developed to run on a parallel distributed memory
	  machine, although it also runs on normal unix boxes.
	  - KnightCap does not have an opening book---instead it keeps a file
	  (brain.dat) of losing moves and inserts them in the hash table at the
	  start of each search. At present it has about 1500 entries, and
	  this makes it a pretty competitive opening player.
	  - KnightCap learns the parameters of its evaluation function as it
	  plays. The most dramatic example of how this helps is an experiment
	  we conducted on FICS in which KnightCap learnt from a 1650 player
	  to a 2100 player in just 300 games.
	  
	  KnightCap now beats gnuchess consistently and is within "coo-ee" of
	  crafty, although I think it needs deeper search or some more dramatic
	  selective search to be truly competitive with the best micro
	  programs.

	  the hiscore board include becoming the highest ranked head of a guild,

	  possessions and experience. The game (via the oracle) may impose some

	  oracle's advice. There *is* a "total winner" status, by the way.
	  
	  Omega, unlike lesser games is incredibly amusing to play. Laurence P.
	  Brothers (the primary author) is the Oscar Wilde of rouge-like games.
	  Many omega concepts, but not great sense of humor were later stolen
	  for use in ADOM.
	  
	  Omega offers a richness of playing detail that goes beyond a simple
	  game like rogue. However, the majority of gameplay is very similar to
	  rogue, hack, ultrarogue, larn, and other such games. The player is

	  in a window and play for two or three minutes while you take a
	  break from whatever else you were doing. And he was also annoyed
	  that every time he found a good game on (say) Unix, it wasn't
	  available the next time he was sitting at a Windows machine, or
	  vice versa; so he arranged that everything in my personal puzzle
	  collection will happily run on both those platforms and more. When
	  he finds (or perhaps invent) further puzzle games that he likes,
	  they'll be added to this collection and will immediately be available
	  on both platforms. And if anyone feels like writing any other front
	  ends - Mac OS pre-10, PocketPC, or whatever it might be - then all

	  Othello game for GNOME2

	  Sirius is a program for playing the game of othello.  The program includes
	  an AI (Artificial Intelligence) opponent which plays at a very challenging
	  level and is actually quite hard to beat.  The AI opponent's strength can
	  therefore be adjusted in several ways to give you a suitable opponent.
	  
	  The AI opponent uses a plain alpha-beta search with hashing to figure out
	  which move to make.  To be able to tell a good position from a bad one, it
	  uses a pattern based evaluation function.  The pattern used is the 9 discs
	  surrounding each corner and the 8 discs creating the edge of the board.
	  The evaluation function also takes mobility, potential mobility and parity
	  into count.  For the initial 9 moves the AI opponent optionally uses a
	  simple opening book.  During midgame it searches and evaluates about
	  200.000 nodes per second on a PIII 750 MHz, in the endgame this number is
	  significantly higher due to more transpositions and a less expensive

	  Tetris-like puzzle game

	  Xpuyopuyo is a Tetris-like puzzle game where you strive to match up four
	  "blobs" of the same color.  Each match gives you points, and also dumps gray
	  rocks on your opponent which are irritating and troublesome to get rid of.
	  Multiple matches at one time score more points, and result in more rocks
	  being dumped on the opponent (much to their dismay).  First person to fill
	  up their screen with puyopuyo blobs loses.
