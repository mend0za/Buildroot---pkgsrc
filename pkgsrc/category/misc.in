	  Getopt(1) is a program to help shell scripts parse command-line

	  (versions up to 2.7.1) for Linux. But, there were some problems
	  with that getopt(1) implementation, as listed in the 'BUGS' section
	  of its man-page:
	  * Whatever getopt(3) has.
	  * Arguments containing white space or imbedded shell metacharacters
	  generally will not survive intact; this looks easy to fix but
	  isn't.
	  * The error message for an invalid option is identified as
	  coming from getopt rather than from the shell procedure
	  containing the invocation of getopt; this again is hard to
	  fix.
	  * The precise best way to use the set command to set the
	  arguments without disrupting the value(s) of shell options
	  varies from one shell version to another.
	  Additionally, the example in the manual-page does not run correctly
	  (at least not with any bash shell I have tried).
	  
	  This implementation of getopt(1) solves some of these problems,
	  while still staying (for all practical purposes) completely compatible
	  with other getopt(1) implementations. It has replaced the old
	  util-linux version, but it should be useful for other Unixes too.

	  Sophisticated flash-card tool which optimizes your learning process

	  The Mnemosyne Project has two aspects:
	  
	  * It's a sophisticated free flash-card tool which optimizes
	  your learning process.
	  * It's a research project into the nature of long-term memory.
	  
	  The Mnemosyne software resembles a traditional flash-card program
	  to help you memorise question/answer pairs, but with an important
	  twist: it uses a sophisticated algorithm to schedule the best time
	  for a card to come up for review. Difficult cards that you tend to
	  forget quickly will be scheduled more often, while Mnemosyne won't
	  waste your time on things you remember well.
	  
	  While you use the software, detailed statistics can be kept on your
	  learning process. If you want, these logs can be uploaded in a
	  transparent and anonymous way to a central server for analysis.
	  
	  This data will be valuable to study the behaviour of our memory
	  over a very long time period. As an additional benefit, the results
	  will be used to improve the scheduling algorithms behind the software
	  even further.

	  consisting of somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 to 50 equal sized parts.
	  These parity files contain a Reed-Solomon encoding of the original files.
	  He'll then post all of them along with the original parts, so if any number
	  of those original parts are lost or corrupted in transit (up to the number
	  of parity files), a receiver may reconstruct them from only that number
	  of parity files.
	  
	  Though quickly growing in popularity for its intended application, the

	  applicatons as well. The format itself is in the public domain.

	  interactions between the two.
	  
	  Teseq is primarily targeted at individuals who possess a basic
	  understanding of terminal control sequences, especially CSI sequences;
	  however, by default Teseq will try to identify and describe the
	  sequences that it encounters, and the behavior they might produce in a
	  terminal.
	  
	  Teseq describes control functions as they are interpreted by
	  VT100-compatible terminals, and/or terminals compliant with the ECMA-48 /
	  ISO/IEC 6429 standard. Teseq does _not_ support describing control
	  functions according to terminal-specific definitions in a database such
	  as termcap or terminfo, though future versions may include limited
	  support for that (*note Future Enhancements::).  Therefore, the
