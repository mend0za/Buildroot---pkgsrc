	  This is the public release of InterNet News (INN). This work is

	  InterNetNews is a complete Usenet system.  The cornerstone of the
	  package is innd, an NNTP server that multiplexes all I/O. Newsreading
	  is handled by a separate server, nnrpd, that is spawned for each
	  client.  Both innd and nnrpd have some slight variances from the
	  NNTP protocol.
	  
	  You can set the environment variable INN_SPOOL to whatever you like
	  to change the default spool directory when building this pkg.

	  NNTP news exchange program

	  Newsx is an NNTP client for Unix. It will connect to a remote NNTP server and
	  post outgoing articles batched by the news system, as well as fetch incoming
	  articles.
	  
	  It provides the NNTP capabilities required for small local news spools on
	  installations with NNTP access only through limited ISP accounts. It works well
	  via a dialup SLIP/PPP connection.
	  
	  Newsx is also well suited for large spools with normal feeds, being used for
	  pulling newsgroups from specific NNTP servers that are not distributed in the
	  usual manner. Since newsx obeys the normal news spool configuration file and
	  requires little or no specific configuration, the administrative burden should
	  be minimized.

	  features:
	  * Automatic multi-part post joining
	  * Automatic binary decoding (using uulib)
	  * Caches header data for quick access
	  * Full multi-server support, transparently joining parts

	  * Full multi-group support, transparently joining parts from
	  multiple newsgroups
	  * Automatic retries on network errors
	  * Resumes after the last part successfully downloaded
	  * Dupe file detection to avoid unneeded downloads
	  * Select what to retrieve based upon a regular expresson (-r),
	  or even a more complex expression (-R) based upon any of the
	  file's subject, author, lines, bytes, # of parts we have,
	  # of parts req, date, age, messageid, and references.
	  * Search for newsgroups based on their names and/or descriptions
	  * Automatic handling of PAR and PAR2 files retrieves only as many
	  recovery files as necessary to repair any missing/damaged files.

	  NNTP multi-server caching daemon

	  NNTPCache is Squid for news (plus lots more).
	  
	  NNTPCache can take reader loads off major news-servers. Besides its
	  super efficient execution, a single or multi-layer concentric ring of
	  NNTPCaches can be arranged about one or more central news-servers on a
	  DNS round-robin basis. Such a wall of NNTPCaches provides drop-in
	  scalability, redundancy, authentication & security for even the
	  largest news-server heart. NNTPCache can transparently stitch multiple
	  split news-servers (e.g, one news-server carrying alt.binaries.*,
	  another carrying alt.*, and another carrying everything else) back
	  together, allowing news-server administrators to spread their news
	  feeds over multiple machines, or to out-source selected components.
	  
	  NNTPCache minimizes the effects of news-server down time, by continuing
	  to provide cached news-data in the face of news-server fall-over.
	  
	  NNTPCache natively supports a variety of AUTHINFO methods, including
	  /etc/passwd, generic unix pipes, LDAP and radius.

	  news feed.  It is NOT designed to feed 10,000 groups and 3 Gigs of articles
	  a day.
	  
	  This package contains software for copying news from an NNTP server to your
	  local machine, and copying replies back up to an NNTP server.
	  
	  The suck/rpost combination allows you to run your own INN/CNEWS site,
	  controlling where you get your news, and where you post outgoing articles.
	  Suck/rpost use only standard NNTP commands that are used by your favorite
	  news reader (tin, xvnews, strn) such as POST and ARTICLE.  If you can use tin
	  or xvnews against a NNTP site, than you can use Suck/Rpost.

	  Threaded version of rn, the classic news reader

	  Trn is Threaded RN -- a newsreader that uses an article's references to
	  order the discussions in a very natural, reply-ordered sequence called
	  threads.  Having the replies associated with their parent articles not
	  only makes following the discussion easier, but also makes it easy to back-
	  track and (re-)read a specific discussion from the beginning.  Trn also
	  has a visual representation of the current thread in the upper right corner
	  of the header, which will give you a feel for how the discussion is going
	  and how the current article is related to the last one you read.
	  
	  In addition, a thread selector makes it easy to browse through a large
	  group looking for interesting articles.  You can even browse through the
	  articles you've already read and select the one(s) you wish to read again.
	  Other nice features include the extract commands for the source and binary
	  groups, thread-oriented kill directives, a better newgroup finding strategy,
	  and lots more.
	  
	  Trn includes a program named "rn", which is backwards-compatible and
	  starts up trn in "non-threaded" mode.

	  Usenet News reader for the X window system

	  XRN is a Usenet News reader for the X window system.  It requires an
	  NNTP server to talk to (i.e., it cannot read news from local disk
	  files), and the NNTP server must support the XHDR command (most
	  servers nowadays do; if yours doesn't, XRN will complain when you try
	  to run it).
	  
	  XRN is currently maintained by Jonathan Kamens.  Bug reports or
	  comments about it should be sent to bug-xrn@kamens.brookline.ma.us.
	  Please do *not* write to that address with basic questions about
	  compiling the program; if you are unfamiliar with compiling X
	  applications and the instructions below are not sufficient, you should
	  seek help at your site.
	  
	  Versions of XRN prior to 7.00 were maintained by Ellen Santovich and
