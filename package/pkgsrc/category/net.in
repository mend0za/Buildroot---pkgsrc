	  * It is reasonably easy to use for simple programs which just want to
	  translate names to addresses, look up MX records, etc.
	  * It can be used in an asynchronous, non-blocking, manner. Many
	  queries can be handled simultaneously.
	  * Responses are decoded automatically into a natural representation
	  for a C program - there is no need to deal with DNS packet formats.
	  * Sanity checking (eg, name syntax checking, reverse/forward
	  correspondence, CNAME pointing to CNAME) is performed automatically.
	  * Time-to-live, CNAME and other similar information is returned in an
	  easy-to-use form, without getting in the way.
	  * There is no global state in the library; resolver state is an
	  opaque data structure which the client creates explicitly. A
	  program can have several instances of the resolver.
	  * Errors are reported to the application in a way that distinguishes
	  the various causes of failure properly.
	  * Understands conventional resolv.conf, but this can overridden by
	  environment variables.
	  * Flexibility. For example, the application can tell adns to: ignore
	  environment variables (for setuid programs), disable hostname
	  syntax sanity checks to return arbitrary data, override or ignore
	  resolv.conf in favour of supplied configuration, etc.
	  * Believed to be correct ! For example, will correctly back off to
	  TCP in case of long replies or queries, or to other nameservers if
	  several are available. It has sensible handling of bad responses etc.

	  and finally build up a SLIP connection between the tty port and the
	  kernel.  To do so, dip offers an own very simple command language (a
	  mostly complete description can be found in the man page).
	  
	  Dip can handle both incoming and outgoing connections using password
	  security for incoming connections.
	  
	  For more details, have a look at the man page!

	  The Internet Routing Registry Toolset - client to IRRd

	  IRRToolSet is a suite of policy analysis tools to operate with
	  routing policies in RPSL [RFC 2622] format, registered in an
	  Internet Routing Registry(IRR). The main goal of the project is
	  to make routing information more convenient and useful for
	  network engineers, by providing tools for automated router configuration,
	  routing policies analysis, and maintenance.
	  
	  This package contains the programs rtconfig, peval and rpslcheck.
	  
	  IRRToolSet started life as RAToolSet from ISI.edu, was then kept by RIPE NCC
	  for a while, and is currently maintained at ISC.
	  
	  THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION (although a release candidate).

	  effort is made to keep the parser and lexer compatible with standard
	  Unix yacc.  Currently, flex is required to generate the lexical
	  scanner.
	  
	  With libIDL, you can parse an IDL file which will be automatically run
	  through the C preprocessor (on systems with one available), and have
	  detailed error and warning messages displayed.  On a compilation
	  without errors, the tree is returned to the custom application.
	  libIDL performs compilation phases from lexical analysis to nearly
	  full semantic analysis with some optimizations, and will attempt to
	  generate meaningful errors and warnings for invalid or deprecated IDL.

	  C library for executing name service queries asynchronously

	  libc and libresolv.
	  
	  In contrast to GNU's asynchronous name resolving API getaddrinfo_a(),
	  libasyncns does not make use of UNIX signals for reporting completion
	  of name queries. Instead, the API exports a standard UNIX file
	  descriptor which may be integerated cleanly into custom main loops.
	  
	  In contrast to asynchronous DNS resolving libraries like libdenise,
	  skadns, adns, libasyncns is just an asynchronous wrapper around
	  the libc's synchronous getaddrinfo() API, which has the advantage
	  of allowing name resolution using techniques like Multicast DNS,
	  LDAP or NIS using standard libc NSS (Name Service Switch) modules.
	  libasyncns is compatible with IPv6 if the underlying libc is.
	  
	  libasyncns is very tiny, consisting of just one header and one
	  source file. It has no dependencies besides libc.
	  
	  By default libasyncns spawns a number of worker threads (LWPs) to
	  process name queries. Alternatively or when POSIX Threads are not
	  supported, libasyncns can fork() off worker processes instead.

	  Apple's Bonjour software derives from the ongoing standardization
	  work of the IETF Zero Configuration Networking Working Group:

	  The Zeroconf Working Group has identified three requirements for Zero
	  Configuration Networking:
	  1. An IP address (even when there is no DHCP server to assign one)
	  2. Name-to-address translation (even when there is no DNS server)
	  3. Discovery of Services on the network (again, without infrastucture)
	  
	  Requirement 1 is met by self-assigned link-local addresses, as
	  described in "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses"
	  <http://files.zeroconf.org/draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal.txt>
	  
	  Requirement 2 is met by sending DNS-like queries via Multicast (mDNS).
	  
	  Requirement 3 is met by DNS Service Dicsovery (DNS-SD).
	  
	  Self-assigned link-local address capability has been available since
	  1998, when it first appeared in Windows '98 and in Mac OS 8.5.
	  Implementations for other platforms also exist.
	  
	  The mDNSResponder project allows us to meet requirements 2 and 3.
	  It provides the ability for the user to identify hosts using names
	  instead of dotted-decimal IP addresses, even if the user doesn't have a

	  Extensible network and system monitoring utility

	  nameservers, ethernet load, port reachability, host performance, SNMP traps,
	  modem line usage, appletalk & novell routes/services, BGP peers, syslog
	  files, etc. The software is extensible and new monitors can be added easily.
	  
	  The software consists of a number of individual, standalone monitoring agents
	  that poll the various network and system parameters and put it into a common
	  data format.  All the monitors have a common display and postprocessing
	  interface (such as logging, notification, etc.). The design allows running
	  just one set of monitoring agents and *any* number of display agents, and all
	  of the displays see the same consistent set of data. Additionally, each event
	  is assigned a severity (determined by comparing against user defined threshold
	  values) which is gradually escalated, thus preventing false alarms and a
	  customized priority notification based on the severity. There are four
	  severity levels ranging from Critical thru Info, and each event typically
	  steps through each one of these severities until it reaches its maximum
	  allowed level.

	  automatically detects servers that are down and distributes clients among
	  the available servers.  This gives high availability and scalable
	  performance.
	  
	  The load balancing algorithm keeps track of clients and will try to
	  send them back to the server they visited the last time.  The client
	  table has a number of slots (default 2048, settable through command-line
	  arguments).  When the table is full, the least recently used one will
	  be thrown out to make room for the new one.
	  
	  This is superior to a simple round-robin algorithm, which sends a client
	  that connects repeatedly to different servers.  Doing so breaks
	  applications that maintain state between connections in the server,
	  including most modern web applications.
	  
	  When pen detects that a server is unavailable, it scans for another
	  starting with the server after the most recently used one.  That way
	  we get load balancing and "fair" failover for free.

	  wished to include Linux servers in PPTP established VPNs.  PoPToP resolves
	  that problem by allowing Linux servers to function seamlessly in the PPTP
	  VPN environment.  This enables administrators to leverage the considerable
	  benefits of both Microsoft and Linux.  The current pre-release version
	  supports Windows 95/98/NT/2000 PPTP clients and PPTP Linux clients.  PoPToP
	  is free GNU software.
	  
	  The PoPTop pre-release server is not yet fully optimised.  It has been
	  released early so as to encourage other developers to become involved in
	  its development.  On release, PoPToP will be fully compliant with IETF PPTP
	  Internet Draft and it will seamlessly support Windows PPTP clients with the
	  full range of encryption and authentication features.
	  
	  Features for version 1.0.0:
	  - Works with Windows 2000 clients
	  - Available PPPD patch allows Windows compatible encryption and
	  authentication. (MSCHAPv2 and MPPE 40-128 bit RC4 encryption)
	  - Support for multiple clients
	  - Works with Windows 95/98/NT PPTP clients
	  - Works with C. S. Ananian's PPTP Linux clients

	help
	  

	  tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunnelling and
	  encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet.
	  
	  Because the VPN appears to the IP level network code as a normal network
	  device, there is no need to adapt any existing software. This allows VPN
	  sites to share information with each other over the Internet without exposing
	  any information to others. In addition, tinc has the following features:
	  
	  o Encryption, authentication and compression
	  All traffic is optionally compressed using zlib or LZO, and OpenSSL is
	  used to encrypt the traffic and protect it from alteration with message
	  authentication codes and sequence numbers.
	  o Automatic full mesh routing
	  Regardless of how you set up the tinc daemons to connect to each
	  other, VPN traffic is always (if possible) sent directly to the
	  destination, without going through intermediate hops.
	  o Easily expand your VPN
	  When you want to add nodes to your VPN, all you have to do is add an extra
	  configuration file, there is no need to start new daemons or create and
	  configure new devices or network interfaces.
	  o Ability to bridge ethernet segments
	  You can link multiple ethernet segments together to work like a single
	  segment, allowing you to run applications and games that normally only work
	  on a LAN over the Internet.

	  Obviously this is not a guarantee, but a reflection that I have written
	  the entire codebase with security in mind, and carefully designed the program
	  to be resilient to attack.
	  
	  Recent evidence suggests that vsftpd is also extremely fast (and this is
	  before any explicit performance tuning!)  In tests against wu-ftpd, vsftpd
	  was always faster, supporting over twice as many users in some tests.

	  ywho is another version of rwho, but it is faster than rwho
	  and requires no /usr/spool/rwho/rwhod.*.  Note that rwho
	  wastes system resources, but ywho doesn't.  It utilizes SUN
	  RPC and XDR protocol.

	  The ZeroMQ messaging library

	  The 0MQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends the
	  standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by
	  specialised messaging middleware products. 0MQ sockets provide an
	  abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging
	  patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to
	  multiple transport protocols and more.
