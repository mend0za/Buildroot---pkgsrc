	  Drivers for Canon, Epson, Lexmark, and PCL printers

	  Gutenprint is a package of high quality printer drivers for Linux,
	  BSD, Solaris, IRIX, and other UNIX-alike operating systems. In many
	  cases, these drivers rival or exceed the OEM drivers in quality and
	  functionality. Our goal is to produce the highest possible output
	  quality from all supported printers. To that end, we have done
	  extensive work on screening algorithms, color generation, and printer
	  feature utilization. We are continuing our work in all of these areas
	  to produce ever higher quality results, particularly on the
	  ubiquitous, inexpensive inkjet printers that are nonetheless capable
	  of nearly photographic output quality.  Earlier versions of Gutenprint
	  were called gimp-print.
	  
	  This package contains the base library, the Epson utility escputil,
	  cups support, and a gimp2 plugin.

	  \relative c'' { \key c \minor; r8 c16 b c8 g as c16 b c8 d | g,4 }

	  few tools to work with PDF files are already included in the PoDoFo
	  package.
	  
	  The PoDoFo library is a free, portable C++ library which includes
	  classes to parse PDF files and modify their contents into memory.
	  The changes can be written back to disk easily. The parser can also
	  be used to extract information from a PDF file (for example the
	  parser could be used in a PDF viewer). Besides parsing PoDoFo
	  includes also very simple classes to create your own PDF files.
	  All classes are documented so it is easy to start writing your own
	  application using PoDoFo.

	  MusixTeX macros to typeset bagpipe music

	  BagpipeTex is a set of MusixTeX macros to typeset bagpipe music.
	  
	  Bagpipe music is written slightly differently than regular music and
	  sequences of gracenotes are often viewed as tokens rather than sequences
	  of individual notes.  These differences make it very difficult to
	  typeset bagpipe music with plain old MusixTeX.  Therefore BagpipeTeX has
	  been written by Walt Innes (walt@slac.stanford.edu).  This is a macro
	  package for use on top of MusixTex, which is itself a macro package for
	  use with LaTeX.
	  
	  Once BagpipeTeX is installed, you can then process BagpipeTeX files
	  exactly the same as you would a regular MusixTeX file.  For example:
	  
	  musixtex foo
	  musixflx foo
	  musixtex foo
	  
	  This will give you foo.dvi which then can be processed like any other
	  .dvi.  Use dvips to convert it into a postscript file or print it to a
	  Postscript printer.  Then ps2pdf may be used to convert the Postscript
	  file into a PDF file.

	  Arrows for use in chemistry

	  LaTeX can be used to typeset many kinds of different documents, but
	  typesetting chemical reactions is esthetically not very pleasing because
	  LaTeX's own arrows \rightarrow, \leftarrow and \rightleftharpoons which
	  you might use for this purpose are too short and the arrow heads are not
	  like the "standard" ones you will find in books or journals on chemistry.
	  
	  The macro chemarrow.sty in conjunction with the font arrow.mf is supposed
	  to make the typesetting of chemical reaction schemes in LaTeX easier and
	  especially nicer looking.
	  
	  This bundle consists of a font (available as metafont source,
	  metapost source, and generated type 1 versions), and a package
	  to use it. The arrows in the font are designed to look more

	  Package for typesetting exam scripts

	  Provides a class exam, which eases production of exams, even by a

	  parts of questions, subparts of parts, and subsubparts of subparts,
	  all with optional point values, (ii) create a grading table, indexed
	  either by question number (listing each question and the total
	  possible points for that question) or by page number (listing each
	  page with points and the total possible points for that page), and
	  (iii) create headers and footers that are each specified in three
	  parts: one part to be left justified, one part to be centered, and one
	  part to be right justified, in the manner of fancyhdr Headers and/or
	  footers can be different on the first page of the exam, can be
	  different on the last page of the exam, and can vary depending on
	  whether the page number is odd or even, or on whether the current page
	  continues a question from a previous page, or on whether the last
	  question on the current page continues onto the following page.
	  Multiple line headers and/or footers are allowed, and it is easy to
	  increase the part of the page devoted to headers and/or footers to
	  allow for this.

	  Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing' Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally)
	  by 85%.  The package is supplied with a (unix) shell file for a
	  'pslatex' command that allows standard LaTeX documents to be
	  processed, without needing to edit the file.  Note that current psnfss
	  uses a different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
	  as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available now, than
	  there were when pslatex was designed).  As a result, pslatex is widely

	  be preferred to version.sty for documents where significant chunks of
	  text may be excluded.
