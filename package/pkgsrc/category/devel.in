	help
	  Object containers and generic algorithms for Objective-C

	  ObjectiveLib provides two primary services: containers and algorithms.  An
	  important part of the library that keeps everything moving is iterators.
	  Iterators perform two functions: they provide access to elements stored in
	  containers and they provide a way for generice algorithms to operate on
	  elements of almost any type of container. Algorithms take iterators as
	  arguments, and thus never have any knowledge of what type of container
	  they happen to be affecting.
	  
	  ObjectiveLib is designed to offer the same functionality to Objective-C
	  programmers that the Standard Template Library offers to C++ programmers.
	  Therefore, anyone familiar with the STL will have no trouble using and
	  understanding the machinery of ObjectiveLib.
	  
	  An important component used by all services of ObjectiveLib is the
	  memory allocator.  All containers allocate memory using an associated
	  memory allocator.  This includes memory used to store elements in the
	  container, iterators, and any temporary buffers that may be needed.
	  Algorithms also need to allocate memory, so there is an allocator
	  associated with the OLAlgorithm class.  Though the algorithm allocator
	  appears static, in fact an allocator is associated with each thread.
	  Therefore, memory allocation when using algorithms is thread-safe.

	  Reindenter and reformatter of C++, C and Java source code

	  When indenting source code, we as programmers have a tendency to
	  use both spaces and tab characters to create the wanted indentation.
	  Moreover, some editors by default insert spaces instead of tabs
	  when pressing the tab key, and other editors (Emacs for example)
	  have the ability to "pretty up" lines by automatically setting up
	  the white space before the code on the line, possibly inserting
	  spaces in a code that up to now used only tabs for indentation.
	  
	  Since the NUMBER of space characters showed on screen for each tab
	  character in the source code changes between editors (until the
	  user sets up the number to his liking...), one of the standard
	  problems facing programmers when moving from one source code editor
	  to another is that code containing both spaces and tabs that was
	  up to now perfectly indented, suddently becomes a mess to look at
	  when changing to another editor. Even if you as a programmer take
	  care to ONLY use spaces or tabs, looking at other peoples source
	  code can still be problematic.
	  
	  To address this problem I have created Artistic Style - a series
	  of filters, written in C++, that automatically reindent & reformat
	  C/C++/Java source files. These can be used from a command line, or
	  it can be incorporated as classes in another C++ program.

	  As regards developers, ATF provides the necessary means to easily create

	  As regards users, it simplifies the process of running the test suites and,
	  in special, encourages end users to run them often: they do not need to
	  have source trees around nor any other development tools installed to be
	  able to certify that a given piece of software works on their machine as

	  A garbage collector is something which automatically frees malloc'd
	  memory for you by working out what parts of memory your program
	  no longer has pointers to.  As a result, garbage collectors can also
	  inform you of memory leaks (if they find memory they can free, it means
	  you have lost all of your pointers to it, but you didn't free it).
	  
	  This package has two libraries and some include files:
	  libgc.a - a garbage collection library, replaces malloc/free/new/delete/etc
	  with versions that do automatic garbage collection
	  libleak.a - a leak detection library, which is just libgc.a compiled with
	  different switches.
	  
	  C programs may be linked against either of these, and should run (with
	  GC or leak detection) without change.  C++ programs must include a header
	  to use garbage collection, though leak detection should work without
	  such source code modifications.  See the man page and header files.
	  
	  PS: garbage collection is addictive.

	  conjunction with the native build environment. Simple configuration
	  files placed in each source directory (called CMakeLists.txt files)
	  are used to generate standard build files (e.g., makefiles on Unix and
	  projects/workspaces in Windows MSVC) which are used in the usual
	  way. CMake can compile source code, create libraries, generate
	  wrappers, and build executables in arbitrary combinations. CMake
	  supports in-place and out-of-place builds, and can therefore support
	  multiple builds from a single source tree. CMake also supports static
	  and dynamic library builds.  Another nice feature of CMake is that it
	  generates a cache file that is designed to be used with a graphical
	  editor.  For example, when CMake runs, it locates include files,
	  libraries, and executable, and may encounter optional build
	  directives. This information is gathered into the cache, which may be

	  Run CVS pserver in a chroot-ed environment

	  cvsd is a wrapper program for cvs in pserver mode. It will run 'cvs
	  pserver' under a special uid/gid in a chroot jail.
	  
	  cvsd is run as a daemon and is controlled through a configuration
	  file. It is relatively easy to configure and tools are provided
	  for easily setting up a rootjail.
	  
	  This server can be useful if you want to run a public cvs pserver.
	  You should however be aware of the security limitations of running
	  a cvs pserver. If you want any kind of authentication you should
	  really consider using secure shell as a secure authentication
	  mechanism and transport. Passwords used in cvs pserver are transmitted
	  in plaintext and this wrapper won't change that.
	  
	  This server adds a layer of security to cvs. cvs is a very powerful
	  tool and is capable of running scripts and other things. By running
	  cvs in a rootjail it is possible to limit the amount of "damage"
	  cvs can do if it is exploited.  It is generally a good idea to run
	  cvsd without any write permissions to any directory on the system.

	  - DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which makes all
	  tests (if correctly written) portable to any host or target
	  where a program must be tested.  For instance, a test for
	  GDB can run (from any Unix based host) on any target
	  architecture supported by DejaGnu. Currently DejaGnu runs
	  tests on several single board computers, whose operating
	  software ranges from just a boot monitor to a full-fledged,
	  Unix-like realtime OS.
	  
	  - DejaGnu is written in expect, which in turn uses Tcl
	  (Tool command language).  The framework comprises two parts:
	  the testing framework and the testsuites themselves. Tests

	  Library for speedy storage, retrieval, and compression

	  EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitrary set of chunks of
	  data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a
	  zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on.
	  It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is needed,
	  and it was much simpler to implement this once here.
	  
	  EET is extremely fast, small and simple.  EET files can be very small
	  and highly compressed, making them very optimal for just sending
	  across the Internet without having to archive, compress or decompress
	  and install them.  They allow for lightning-fast random-access reads
	  once created, making them perfect for storing data that is written
	  once (or rarely) and read many times, but the program does not want to
	  have to read it all in at once.
	  
	  It also can encode and decode data structures in memory, as well as
	  image data for saving to EET files or sending across the network to
	  other machines, or just writing to arbitrary files on the system.  All
	  data is encoded in a platform independent way and can be written and

	  There are plenty of open-source version control systems available

	  1. Bug Tracking And Wiki - In addition to doing distributed
	  version control like Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports
	  distributed bug tracking and distributed wiki all in a single
	  integrated package.
	  
	  2. Web Interface - Fossil has a built-in and easy-to-use web
	  interface that simplifies project tracking and promotes situational
	  awareness. Simply type "fossil ui" from within any check-out
	  and Fossil automatically opens your web browser in a page that
	  gives detailed history and status information on that project.
	  
	  3. Autosync - Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to
	  keep projects moving forward by reducing the amount of needless
	  forking and merging often associated distributed projects.
	  
	  4. Self-Contained - Fossil is a single stand-alone executable
	  that contains everything needed to do configuration management.
	  Installation is trivial: simply download a precompiled binary
	  for Linux, Mac, or Windows and put it on your $PATH. Easy-to-compile
	  source code is available for users on other platforms. Fossil
	  sources are also mostly self-contained, requiring only the "zlib"
	  library and the standard C library to build.
	  
	  5. Simple Networking - Fossil uses plain old HTTP (with proxy
	  support) for all network communications, meaning that it works
	  fine from behind restrictive firewalls. The protocol is bandwidth
	  efficient to the point that Fossil can be used comfortably over
	  a dial-up internet connection.
	  
	  6. CGI Enabled - No server is required to use fossil. But a
	  server does make collaboration easier. Fossil supports three
	  different yet simple server configurations. The most popular is
	  a 2-line CGI script. This is the approach used by the self-hosting
	  fossil repositories.
	  
	  7. Robust & Reliable - Fossil stores content in an SQLite database
	  so that transactions are atomic even if interrupted by a power
	  loss or system crash. Furthermore, automatic self-checks verify
	  that all aspects of the repository are consistent prior to each
	  commit. In over two years of operation, no work has ever been
	  lost after having been committed to a Fossil repository.

	  develop visual applications.  It can also integrate with GNOME via the
	  Gnome-guile module.  (For glib2, see guile-gobject instead.)
	  
	  Guile-gtk was started by Marius Vollmer <mvo@zagadka.ping.de> and
	  is currently maintained by Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net> and other
	  intrepid Guile hackers around the world.

	  limited-scope CPAN for Guile".
	  
	  Also, it can be seen as a code staging area for Guile; the Guile
	  developers could decide to integrate some of the code into
	  guile-core. An example for a possible candidate is SRFI-35.

	  With HUnit (as with JUnit) you can easily create tests, name them, group
	  them into suites, and execute them, with the framework checking the
	  results automatically.  Test specification in HUnit is even more concise
	  and flexible than in JUnit, thanks to the nature of the Haskell language.

	  2. Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs
	  and procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
	  For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that
	  capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently

	  Features:
	  o 	Inspection of variable values in a tree structure.
	  o	Direct member: For certain compound data types the most important
	  member values are displayed next to the variable name, so that it is
	  not necessary to expand the subtree of that variable in order to see
	  the member value. For example, you don't need to go into a variable of
	  type QString if you want to see the string that the variable holds.
	  KDbg can also display Qt 2.0's QString values, which are Unicode
	  strings.
	  o	Debugger at your finger tips: The basic debugger functions (step, next,
	  run, finish, until, set/clear/enable/disable breakpoint) are bound to
	  function keys F5 through F10. Quick and easy.
	  o	Of course, lots of other basic functions: View source code, search
	  text, set program arguments and environment variables, display
	  arbitrary expressions. Everything you need to debug a program, eh!
	  o	Debugging of core dumps, attaching to running processes is possible.

	  interface. Note that these string utilities are built upon a generic

	  so they are also available to any 3rd party compatible allocators.

	  "--foo:stuff", or "--foo stuff", respectively)
	  
	  The flavors that take arguments also come in array flavors.  With an
	  array, you specify a pointer to a vector of the basic type, instead of
	  just a pointer to a basic type.  This allows the option to appear more
	  than once, and the new values are appended to the array.  Optionally,
	  you can also specify a separator character, so that multiple array
	  elements can be parsed up from a single instance of the option.
	  
	  Options can start with either a single dash or a double dash, but see

	  PGM reliable multicast library implementing RFC 3208

	  OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General

	  PGM is a reliable and scalable multicast protocol that enables
	  receivers to detect loss, request retransmission of lost data, or
	  notify an application of unrecoverable loss.  PGM is a
	  receiver-reliable protocol, which means the receiver is responsible
	  for ensuring all data is received, absolving the sender of reception
	  responsibility.  PGM runs over a best effort datagram service,
	  currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
	  switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
	  
	  PGM is appropriate for applications that require duplicate-free
	  multicast data delivery from multiple sources to multiple receivers.
	  PGM does not support acknowledged delivery, nor does it guarantee
	  ordering of packets from multiple senders.
	  
	  PGM is primarly used on internal networks to help integrate disparate
	  systems through a common communication platform.  A lack of IPv4
	  multicast-enabled infrastructure leads to limited capability for
	  internet applications, IPv6 promotes multicast to be a part of the
	  core functionality of IP but may still be disabled on core routers.

	  The library uses an opaque data type to represent a tree structure
	  made of strings, data blocks, arrays and dictionaries (key-value pair
	  lists). This structure can be manipulated, written out to and read in
	  from a file, and synchronized with the contents of a file.
	  The purpose of PL is to closely mimick the behaviour of the property
	  lists used in GNUstep/OPENSTEP (there formed with the NSString,
	  NSData, NSArray and NSDictionary classes) and to be compatible with
	  it. PL enables programs that use configuration or preference files to
	  make these compatible with GNUstep/OPENSTEP's user defaults handling
	  mechanism, without needing to use Objective-C or GNUstep/OPENSTEP
	  themselves.

	  Lightweight C++ API for Lua

	  Lutok is a lightweight C++ API library for Lua.
	  
	  Lutok provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API to ease the
	  interaction between C++ and Lua.  These wrappers make intensive use of
	  RAII to prevent resource leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report
	  errors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always
	  left untouched in the face of errors.  The library also provides a small
	  subset of miscellaneous utility functions built on top of the wrappers.
	  
	  Lutok focuses on providing a clean and safe C++ interface; the drawback
	  is that it is not suitable for performance-critical environments.  In
	  order to implement error-safe C++ wrappers on top of a Lua C binary
	  library, Lutok adds several layers or abstraction and error checking
	  that go against the original spirit of the Lua C API and thus degrade
	  performance.

	  macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
	  shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
	  generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.
	  
	  GNU `m4' was originally written by Rene Seindal, with subsequent
	  changes by Franc,ois Pinard and other volunteers on the Internet.  All
	  names and email addresses can be found in the file `THANKS' from the
	  GNU `m4' distribution.
	  
	  This is release 1.4.  It is now to be considered stable, future
	  releases are only meant to fix bugs, increase speed, or improve
	  documentation.  However...
	  
	  An experimental feature, which would improve `m4' usefulness, allows
	  for changing the syntax for what is a "word" in `m4'.  You should use:
	  ./configure --enable-changeword
	  
	  if you want this feature compiled in.  The current implementation slows

	  Simple, extensible literate-programming tool

	  INTRODUCTION --- WHAT IS NOWEB, ANYWAY?
	  
	  noweb is a literate-programming tool like FunnelWEB or nuweb, only
	  simpler.  A noweb file contains program source code interleaved with
	  documentation.  When noweb is invoked, it writes the program source
	  code to the output files mentioned in the noweb file, and it writes
	  a TeX file for typeset documentation.
	  
	  noweb is designed to meet the needs of literate programmers while
	  remaining as simple as possible.  Its primary advantages are
	  simplicity, extensibility, and language-independence.  noweb works
	  ``out of the box'' with any programming language, and supports TeX,
	  latex, and HTML (Mosaic) back ends.  A back end to support full
	  hypertext or indexing takes about 250 lines; a simpler one can be
	  written in 40 lines of awk.  The primary sacrifice relative to WEB
	  is that code is not prettyprinted.
	  
	  If you're brand new to literate programming, check out the FAQ for
	  the USENET newsgroup comp.programming.literate.  There are also some
	  resources available through the noweb home page.

	  Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval

	  String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance,

	  and constructors, which speeds code up at runtime by a significant

	  difficult to control the scope it's used in (which determines which
	  variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite slow,
	  especially if doing a large number of evals.
	  
	  This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides
	  an eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment,
	  other than a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the
	  result of the eval, so that doing repeated evals of the same source,
	  even with a different environment, will be much faster (but note
	  that the description is part of the string to be evaled, so it must
	  also be the same (or non-existent) if caching is to work properly).

	  module from the "Perl Cookbook", by Christiansen and Torkington

	  Perl5 module to prevent leakage of lexical hints

	  There is a bug in Perl's handling of the %^H (lexical hints) variable that
	  causes lexical state in one file to leak into another that is required/used
	  from it. This bug will probably be fixed in Perl 5.10.2, and is definitely
	  fixed in Perl 5.11.0, but in any earlier version it is necessary to work
	  around it. On versions of Perl that require a fix, this module globally
	  changes the behaviour of require and use so that they no longer exhibit the
	  bug. This is the most convenient kind of workaround, and is meant to be
	  invoked by modules that make use of lexical state.
	  
	  The workaround supplied by this module takes effect the first time its
	  import method is called. Typically this will be done by means of a use
	  statement. This should be done before putting anything into %^H that would
	  have a problem with leakage; usually it suffices to do this when loading
	  the module that supplies the mechanism to set up the vulnerable lexical
	  state. Invoking this module multiple times, from multiple lexical-related
	  modules, is not a problem: the workaround is only applied once, and applies
	  to everything.

	  abstract role MooseX::ConfigFromFile, and uses Config::Any to load your
	  configfile. Config::Any will in turn support any of a variety of different
	  config formats, detected by the file extension. See Config::Any for more

	  Like all MooseX::ConfigFromFile -derived configfile loaders, this module is
	  automatically supported by the MooseX::Getopt role as well, which allows
	  specifying -configfile on the commandline.

	  Perl's threads become mainstream).  That is, each session returns
	  execution to POE as quickly as possible so it can parcel out time to
	  the next.
	  
	  POE includes a high-level component architecture.  Components are
	  modular, reusable pieces of programs.  They perform common, often
	  tedious tasks so programmers can work on more interesting things.
	  
	  POE provides medium- and low-level concurrency functions.  Components
	  use them to perform their tasks.  The functions are also available to
	  programmers who prefer to avoid the overhead of components at the
	  expense of writing more code.  Components and custom sessions coexist
	  because they all use the same basic functions.
	  
	  POE supports graphical toolkits such as Tk and Gtk.  It is the only
	  Perl programming framework that does this.  It also supports Curses,
	  HTTP, and other user interfaces.  POE programs can present multiple
	  user interfaces at once.

	  Perl5 module for argument type classification

	  This module provides various type-testing functions. These are intended for
	  functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of data they are
	  operating on. For example, some functions wish to behave differently
	  depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded functions in C++).
	  
	  There are two flavours of function in this module. Functions of the first
	  flavour only provide type classification, to allow code to discriminate
	  between argument types. Functions of the second flavour package up the most
	  common type of type discrimination: checking that an argument is of an
	  expected type. The functions come in matched pairs, of the two flavours,
	  and so the type enforcement functions handle only the simplest requirements
	  for arguments of the types handled by the classification functions.
	  Enforcement of more complex types may, of course, be built using the
	  classification functions, or it may be more convenient to use a module
	  designed for the more complex job, such as Params::Validate.

	  was. Still others, we may want to know what the error code was, and what the
	  error properties were. We don't want to handle objects or data structures for
	  every single return value, but we do want to check error conditions in our

	  Role::Tiny is a minimalist role composition tool.
	  
	  ROLE COMPOSITION
	  
	  Role composition can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful
	  multiple inheritance. The basics of this implementation of roles is:
	  
	  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be
	  composed in from the role.
	  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not
	  implemented, role application will fail loudly.
	  
	  Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins," role
	  composition is the other way around, where the class wins. If multiple
	  roles are applied in a single call (single with statement), then if any
	  of their provided methods clash, an exception is raised unless the class
	  provides a method since this conflict indicates a potential problem.

	  Perl5 module to provide keywords for any, all, none, or one

	  This is a lightweight module which provides 'Junction' operators, the most
	  commonly used being any and all.  Inspired by the Perl6 design docs [1].
	  
	  Provides a limited subset of the functionality of Quantum::Superpositions
	  ([2]).
	  
	  That if you want to match against a regular expression, you must use == or
	  !=. Not =~ or !~. You must also use a regex object, such as qr/\d/, not a
	  plain regex such as /\d/.
	  
	  This module is actually a fork of Perl6::Junction with very few (initial)
	  changes. The reason being that we want to avoid the incendiary name
	  containing Perl6.
	  
	  Quantum::Superpositions provides the same functionality as this, and more.
	  However, this module provides this limited functionality at a much greater
	  runtime speed, with my benchmarks showing between 500% and 6000% improvment.

	  You can also use this to review changes between two pre-patches.

	  you to merge patches together. The resulting patch file only alters each file
	  once.
	  Filterdiff will select the portions of a patch file that apply to files
	  matching (or, alternatively, not matching) a shell wildcard.
	  Fixcvsdiff is for correcting the output of 'cvs diff'.
	  Rediff corrects hand-edited patches, by comparing the original patch with the
	  modified one and adjusting the offsets and counts.
	  Lsdiff displays a short listing of affected files in a patch file, along with
	  (optionally) the line numbers of the start of each patch.
	  Splitdiff separates out patches from a patch file so that each new patch file
	  only alters any given file once. In this way, a file containing several
	  incremental patches can be split into individual incremental patches.
	  Grepdiff displays a list of the files modified by a patch where the patch
	  contains a given regular expression.
	  Recountdiff fixes up counts and offsets in a unified diff.

	  Library providing abstract access to various archives

	  PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various

	  was somewhat inspired by Quake 3's file subsystem. The programmer
	  defines a "write directory" on the physical filesystem. No file
	  writing done through the PhysicsFS API can leave that write directory,
	  for security. For example, an embedded scripting language cannot
	  write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS for all of its I/O,
	  which means that untrusted scripts can run more safely. Symbolic
	  links can be disabled as well, for added safety. For file reading,
	  the programmer lists directories and archives that form a "search
	  path". Once the search path is defined, it becomes a single,
	  transparent hierarchical filesystem. This makes for easy access to
	  ZIP files in the same way as you access a file directly on the
	  disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive that will override
	  a previous archive on a per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives
	  you platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available,
	  the user's home directory, where in the real filesystem your program
	  is running, etc.

	  UNIX/POSIX shell helper for running pipes safely

	  pipestatus - source file for POSIX shell that allows
	  to obtain an exit status of every program in a pipe.
	  
	  MOTIVATION
	  
	  When we program in shell we often run pipes like this
	  
	  prog1 args1 | prog2 args2 | ... | progN argsN
	  
	  POSIX says that exit status of pipe is the exit status of LAST program
	  in it, i.e.  progN in our example. That is, exit status of all other
	  programs in pipe is silently ignored.  But in many situations exit
	  status of all programs in pipe should be checked to make program
	  robust. Some shells like BASH and ZSH have special extensions for
	  doing this but POSIX shell unfortunately doesn't provide an EASY way
	  for doing this.
	  
	  In order to solve the problem, described above pipestatus was written.

	  Query Object Framework

	  QOF, the Query Object Framework, provides a set of C Language
	  utilities for performing generic structured complex queries on a
	  set of data held by a set of C/C++ objects. This framework is unique
	  in that it does NOT require SQL or any database at all to perform
	  the query. Thus, it allows programmers to add query support to
	  their applications without having to hook into an SQL Database.
	  
	  Typically, if you have an app, and you want to add the ability to
	  show a set of reports, you will need the ability to perform queries
	  in order to get the data you need to show a report. Of course, you
	  can always write a set of ad-hoc subroutines to return the data
	  that you need. But this kind of a programming style is not extensible:
	  just wait till you get a user who wants a slightly different report.
	  
	  The idea behind QOF is to provide a generic framework so that any
	  query can be executed, including queries designed by the end-user.
	  Normally, this is possible only if you use a database that supports
	  SQL, and then only if you deeply embed the database into your

	  un-applied, refreshed, etc.
	  
	  The key philosophical concept is that your primary output is patches.
	  Not ".c" files, not ".h" files.  But patches.  So patches are the
	  first-class object here.
	  
	  Quilt was originally based on Andrew Morton's patch scripts published on
	  the Linux kernel mailing list a while ago, but were heavily modified
	  since then.

	  The Reed-Solomon Code is an algebraic code belonging to the class of

	  The Reed Solomon code operates on bytes of fixed length.
	  
	  Given m parity bytes, a Reed-Solomon code can correct up to m byte
	  errors in known positions (erasures), or detect and correct up to m/2
	  byte errors in unknown positions.
	  
	  This is an implementation of a Reed-Solomon code with 8 bit bytes, and
	  a configurable number of parity bytes.  The maximum sequence length
	  (codeword) that can be generated is 255 bytes, including parity bytes.
	  In practice, shorter sequences are used.
	  
	  The more general error-location algorithm is the Berlekamp-Massey
	  algorithm, which will locate up to four errors, by iteratively solving
	  for the error-locator polynomial.  The Modified Berlekamp Massey
	  algorithm takes as initial conditions any known suspicious bytes
	  (erasure flags) which you may have (such as might be flagged by a
	  laser demodulator, or deduced from a failure in a cross-interleaved
	  block code row or column).
	  
	  Once the location of errors is known, error correction is done using
	  the error-evaluator polynomial.

	  Sorted associative collection using Red-Black Trees for Ruby

	  RBTree is a sorted associative collection using Red-Black Tree as
	  the internal data structure. The elements of RBTree are ordered
	  and the interface is the almost same as Hash, so simply you can
	  consider RBTree sorted Hash.
	  
	  Red-Black Tree is a kind of binary tree that automatically balances
	  by itself when a node is inserted or deleted. Thus the complexity
	  for insert, search and delete is O(log N) in expected and worst
	  case. On the other hand the complexity of Hash is O(1). Because
	  Hash is unordered the data structure is more effective than Red-Black
	  Tree as an associative collection.
	  
	  The interface of RBTree is the almost same as Hash although there
	  are some limitations.

	  Conversely, if you like RSpec's approach to declaring example groups and
	  examples (`describe` and `it`) but prefer Test::Unit assertions and mocha, rr
	  or flexmock for mocking, you'll be able to do that without having to load the
	  components of rspec that you're not using.

	  Safe and Fast IO library

	  Sfio is a portable library for managing I/O streams. It provides
	  similar functionality to the ANSI C Standard I/O functions known
	  collectively as Stdio. However, it has a distinct interface and is
	  generally faster and more robust than most Stdio implementations.
	  (For backward compatibility, Sfio provides two Stdio emulation packages.)
	  Sfio also introduces a number of new features and concepts beyond
	  Stdio stream I/O processing:
	  
	  + Automatic locking to avoid concurrent stream accesses,
	  + I/O disciplines to pre/post-process read/write data from/to streams,
	  + Stream stacking for recursive processing of nested streams,
	  + Stream pooling for automatic stream synchronization when I/O
	  operations are performed on different streams,
	  + Buffer reservation for safe access to the internal buffers of streams,
	  + Robust handling of variable-sized records, and
	  + Extensible printf/scanf-like formatting I/O operations.
	  
	  The current distribution of Sfio is Sfio1998. The library handles 64-bit
	  streams on platforms that support 64-bit files. The formatting family of
	  functions (e.g., sfprintf() and sfscanf()) have been extended so that
	  applications can redefine the meanings of predefined patterns as well as
	  define new patterns.

	  SILC provides security services, such as sending private messages entirely
	  secure; noone can see the message except you and the real receiver of the
	  message. SILC also provides same functionality for channels; noone except
	  those clients joined to the channel may see the messages destined to the
	  channel. Communication between client and server is also secured with
	  session keys and all commands, authentication data (such as passwords etc.)
	  and other traffic is entirely secured. The entire network, and all parts of
	  it, is secured.
	  
	  SILC has secure key exchange protocol that is used to create the session keys
	  for each connection. SILC also provides strong authentication based on either

	  our cross-platform GUI toolkit. Qt supports around 15 flavors of Unix,
	  Microsoft Windows, and around 15 different C++ compilers.  We looked at
	  GNU autoconf, but it was Unix-specific and not flexible enough in our
	  opinion. Our makefile system also had to deal with Qt meta object compiler
	  (moc) issues. The moc program extracts meta information from C++ files and
	  generates a C++ file with data tables etc.  It takes extra work to add
	  makefile rules for the moc and wanted to automate this task.

	  Lightweight and robust POSIX compliant regexp matching library

	  TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regexp matching
	  library with some exciting features such as approximate (fuzzy) matching.
	  
	  At the core of TRE is a new algorithm for regular expression matching with
	  submatch addressing. The algorithm uses linear worst-case time in the length
	  of the text being searched, and quadratic worst-case time in the length of
	  the used regular expression. In other words, the time complexity of the
	  algorithm is O(M2N), where M is the length of the regular expression and N
	  is the length of the text. The used space is also quadratic on the length
	  of the regex, but does not depend on the searched string. This quadratic
	  behaviour occurs only on pathological cases which are probably very rare
	  in practice.
	  
	  TRE includes a version of the agrep (approximate grep) command line tool
	  for approximate regexp matching in the style of grep. Unlike other agrep
	  implementations (like the one by Sun Wu and Udi Manber from University of
	  Arizona available  here) TRE agrep allows full regexps of any length, any
	  number of errors, and non-uniform costs for insertion, deletion and

	  to a diff program.  However, the delta is not "compressed", in that the
	  delta's entropy H(P) will be very similar to the entropy of the portions
	  of the TO file not found within the FROM file.  The delta will compress
	  just as well as the TO file will.  This is a fundamentally different
	  method of computing deltas than in the traditional "diff" program.  The
	  diff program and its variants use a least-common-subsequence (LCS)
	  algorithm to find a list of inserts and deletes that will modify the FROM
	  file into the TO file.  LCS is more expensive to compute and is sometimes
	  more useful, especially to the human reader.  Since LCS is a fairly
	  expensive algorithm, diff programs usually divide the input files into
	  newline-separated "atoms" before computing a delta.  This is a fine
	  approximation for text files, but not binary files.
