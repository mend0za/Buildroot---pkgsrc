	  and reject them, to recognize priveledged users and let them gain ops, etc.

	  DCC chat, which allows you to talk to other people lag-free.  Consider it a

	  IRC client written and programmable in perl

	  This is a simple (well, not so simple anymore *grin*) irc client,
	  written in perl and C.
	  
	  It's divided in two parts, a dumb-mode (meaning, no full screen
	  interface) client, dsirc, that can be used stand-alone, programmed in
	  perl, and a separate split-screen front end in C, called ssfe.
	  
	  The main point of running this client is that you can get a reasonable
	  ircII-like interface on an account with a properly installed perl
	  interpreter, with the perl client taking about 55k (and it's usable on
	  its own if you don't have access to a C compiler) and with the
	  interface, once compiled, taking just another 30 or 40k. The two
	  together, while lacking the huge complexity of ircII, make a very usable
	  client. And if you know perl, you'll find you can do quite complicated
	  and interesting things with sirc too :)
	  
	  See /usr/pkg/lib/sirc/README for more usage instructions, and see
	  /usr/pkg/lib/sirc/PROGRAMMING for information on how to extend sirc.
