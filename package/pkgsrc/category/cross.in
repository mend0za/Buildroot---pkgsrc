	  C and math library for Atmel AVR 8-bit microcontrollers

	  avr-libc -- a C and math library for the Atmel AVR controller family
	  
	  This library implements a subset of common C library functions, some
	  Atmel AVR specific additions (like handling AVR's IO facilities,
	  EEPROM etc.), as well as a 32-bit floating point math library (-lm).
	  
	  Everything is designed and implemented to cooperate with avr-gcc and
	  avr-binutils.
	  
	  Please note that this is currently work-in-progress.  Documentation
	  is becoming embedded into the source code which will hopefully get
	  it more complete and up-to-date.  Some parts of the current library
	  have proven to be not all that useful (e. g. timer_enable_int())
	  so they might be removed in a future version.
	  
	  For the time being, some older documentation (more complete but
	  somewhat out of date) is being installed as well.
