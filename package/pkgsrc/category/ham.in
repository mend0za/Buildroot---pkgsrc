	  Uuencode-like file coder for AMPR BBS S&F of binary files

	  7plus is an uuencoder-like file coder for use in Amateur Packet Radio
	  BBS S&F of binary data files. The Packet Radio protocol (AX.25) utilizes
	  8 bits for data transfer whereas most standard terminal programs only
	  use a 7 bits alogarithm. The result is that only 87.5% of the available
	  bandwidth is utilized.
	  
	  7plus fully exploits the capacity of the network by using all 8 bits
	  and hence increasing data throughput. Furthermore, it uses alogarithms
	  which checks for data integrity, detecting, reporting and, whenever
	  possible, correcting data transmission errors that may have occurred due
	  to noise or loss of signal with minimal overheads.

	  - The TNC or PR-controller software is not compatible to TheFirmware and
	  its hostmode, but does support KISS mode
	  - The interface is not on a HF-frequency, but a TCP/IP-based network
	  (local net or internet)
	  - TNT together with DPBox shall be used directly connected to a digipeater
	  using KISS mode (hopefully with CRC) as interface
	  
	  To handle these applications, TFKISS was written. It is in fact a port
	  of the original TheFirmware by NORD><LINK, written for TNC2-hardware.
	  The low level interfaces were changed and adapted to Linux. On the
	  radio side a KISS- and an AXIP-interface take the place of the HDLC/modem

	  About Packet Radio and TNT
	  
	  Packet-Radio is a special mode used by Radio Amateurs to transfer text and
	  data over a radio link. Packet-Radio, as the name suggests, is packet
	  orientated and uses the AX.25-protocol, a special version of X.25
	  to fit Ham Radio needs.
	  
	  The interface between the radio transceiver and terminal/PC is called
	  a Terminal Node Controller (TNC). It implements the AX.25 Protocol and
	  consists of a micro-controller, a radio modem and RS232 interface.
	  
	  Special firmware such as WA8DED-Software and 'The Firmware' by NORD><LINK,
	  which is available for most TNC's, make use of the hostmode protocol via
	  the RS232-interface. The advantage of the hostmode is that it gives a
	  PC control over the TNC. It allows applications to implement features
	  which are not available in terminal mode.
	  
	  TNT (TNc Terminalprogram) is a terminal program which takes advantage
	  of the hostmode protocol implementing features such as virtual screens
	  for multiple traffic channels and various interfaces to other software
	  packages such as tfkiss, dpbox and much more.
