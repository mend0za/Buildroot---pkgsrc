	  Sega Mega drive genesis emulator

	  Generator is an open source emulator designed to emulate the Sega

	  early 1990s.  It is a portable program written in C and has been
	  ported to the Amiga, Macintosh, Windows and even pocket PCs such as
	  the iPAQ and Cassiopeia.  Natively it compiles under unix for X
	  Windows with either tcl/tk or gtk/SDL, for svgalib and even
	  cross-compiles to DOS with djgpp/allegro.
	  
	  Generator uses its own custom 68000 processor emulation which is
	  designed for dynamic recompilation, and uses techniques from this such
	  as block-marking, flag calculation removal, operand pre-calculation,
	  endian pre-conversion etc.  There are approximately 1600 C routines
	  generated by the first stage of compilation to cope with the 67
	  instruction families.  These routines are used as a 'backup' when
	  dynamic recompilation isn't supported on your platform or the
	  recompiler doesn't support a particular instruction.  The CPU engine
	  is by all accounts very fast, whatever the mode.
	  
	  There is a 'test' recompiler written for the ARM processor, but it is
	  no longer supported.  If someone with assembler knowledge wants to put
	  the effort into writing a recompiling back-end for a processor (and it
	  really is major effort), let me know - particularly if you know i386.

	  * SDL audio support (in favour of OSS Audio) which means you can
	  use ESound and others for sharing the sound device among other
	  applications.
	  * Optional mute playing i.e., if you don't have a soundcard or
	  the soundcard is busy you can still play.

	  as it can get even if needs far less than 10% on any modern system.
	  * Working support for Game Genie codes.

	  Palm OS Emulator is an emulator for hardware capable of running the Palm OS

	  To use the emulator you must obtain a ROM image of the Palm OS operating
	  system.  If you have a Palm OS device, you can extract the ROM image directly.
	  
	  Read "UsingPalmOSEmulator.pdf" for details of how to extract ROM images and
	  how to use the emulator.  Run "pose" to start the emulator.

	  The emulator runs at about 8-10MHz 80286 speed on a Sun SparcStation
	  10/40 (without the -mviking flag) and at about 6MHz 8088 speed on a
	  33MHz 80486 box running Linux.
	  
	  I have included a Postscript representation of my project report. It's
	  a bit out of date now, but it's the closest thing I've got to
	  documentation!  I'll do some kind of latex thing for the next

	  The program rather hogs the cpu but unmapping the window (iconifying

	  It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting
	  the PC or to debug system code.
	  * User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can launch

	  the ARM available, so why do another one?  Well, this one will need to
	  allow the instruction set to be modified at run time, and provide not
	  just an execution environment, but also a way of monitoring things
	  like cache hits.
	  
	  To this end a hierarchical model of an ARM CPU has been implemented in
	  C++.  It currently supports:
	  
	  + Arm 6 based core.  Currently able to handle data processing
	  instructions, word/byte load and stores, load/store multiple,
	  branches, 32 bit multiplication, and SWIs.
	  + Support for plugging in different caches - be they unified or
	  separate I & D caches.  Currently only a direct mapped cache is
	  implemented.
	  + Compile for SWARM using ARM targeted gcc.

	  Cross-platform implementation of the Win32 API

	  Willows TWIN is a GNU software package for emulating the Microsoft
	  Win32 API.  It consists of a library set and an emulator program.  The
	  emulator program allows the execution of Windows binary applications
	  on supported platforms; using the native Intel x86 processors, or
	  through the built-in instruction set interpreter.  The native
	  libraries allow programmers natively to build Win32 and MFC
	  applications from source code.

	  The UAE Amiga Emulator

	  UAE allows you to run most of the available Amiga software. It is a software
	  emulation, meaning that no extra or special hardware is needed to do this.
	  The hardware of an Amiga is emulated accurately, so that Amiga software is
	  tricked into thinking it is running on the real thing, with your computer's
	  display, keyboard, harddisk and mouse taking the parts of their emulated

	  Emulator for C64, C128, CBM-II, PET, VIC20, Plus4 and C16

	  VICE is the one and only Versatile Commodore Emulator. It provides
	  emulation of the Commodore 64, 128, VIC20, PET, Plus/4 and C16 8-bit
	  computers within a single package. The emulators run as separate
	  programs, but have the same user interface, share the same settings and
	  support the same file formats.
	  
	  All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with
	  emulation of all the opcodes (both documented and undocumented ones)
	  and accurate timing. Unlike other emulators, VICE aims to be cycle
	  accurate; it tries to emulate chip timings as precisely as possible
	  and does so efficiently.
	  
	  Please do not expect the VIC20, C128 and PET emulators to be as good
	  as the C64 one, as they are still under construction.
	  
	  The current version emulates the C64, the C128, the VIC20, the CBM-II
	  line (B128, B256), Plus/4 and C16, and all the PET models.
