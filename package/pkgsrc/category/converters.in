	  Perl5 module for Base64 and Quoted-Printable encodings

	  This package contains a base64 encoder/decoder and a quoted-printable
	  encoder/decoder.  These encoding methods are specified in RFC 2045 -
	  MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).
	  
	  The base64 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
	  octets in a form that need not be humanly readable. A 65-character
	  subset ([A-Za-z0-9+/=]) of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
	  represented per printable character.
	  
	  The quoted-printable encoding is intended to represent data that
	  largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
	  the ASCII character set.  Non-printable characters are represented by
	  a triplet consisting of the character "=" followed by two hexadecimal
	  digits.
	  
	  The MIME::Base64 and MIME::QuotedPrint modules used to be part of
	  libwww-perl package.  They are now distributed separately (this
	  package).  The main improvement is that the base64 encoder/decoder is
	  implemented by XS functions.  This makes it about 20 times faster than
	  the old implementation in perl.

	  This module is a perl version of python's URL-safe base64 encoder

	  When embedding binary data in URL, it is preferable to use base64
	  encoding. However, two characters ('+' and '/') used in the standard
	  base64 encoding have special meanings in URLs, often leading to
	  re-encoding with URL-encoding, or worse, interoperability problems.
	  
	  To overcome the problem, the module provides a variation of base64
	  codec compatible with python's urlsafe_b64encode / urlsafe_b64decode.

	  Base 32 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of octets in a
	  form that needs to be case insensitive but need not be humanly readable.".
	  
	  The rationale for our encoding is different -- it is to represent arbitrary
	  sequences of octets in a form that is as convenient as possible for human
	  users to manipulate.  In particular, z-base-32 was created in order to serve
	  the Mnet project [3], where 30-octet cryptographic values are encoded into
	  URIs for humans to manipulate.  Anticipated uses of these URIs include cut-
	  and-paste, text editing (e.g. in HTML files), manual transcription via a
	  keyboard, manual transcription via pen-and-paper, vocal transcription over
	  phone or radio, etc.
	  
	  The desiderata for such an encoding are:
	  
	  * minimizing transcription errors -- e.g. the well-known problem of confusing
	  `0' with `O'
	  * embedding into other structures -- e.g. search engines, structured or
	  marked-up text, file systems, command shells
	  * brevity -- Shorter URLs are better than longer ones.
	  * ergonomics -- Human users (especially non-technical ones) should find the
	  URIs as easy and pleasant as possible.  The uglier the URI looks, the worse.

	  * Smart decoder can handle multiple files, including files
	  specified out of order or with nonsense file names.
	  
	  * Easy to use Usenet posting software enables one-liner
	  posting of individual files or groups of files, including creation
	  of SFV/CRC checksum files if desired.
	  
	  * Optional scan mode: automatically locate and decode
	  single or multipart yencoded archives in specified directories
	  or recursively.
	  
	  * Fully compliant with all versions of the yEnc
	  specification (currently v1, v2, v3).
	  
	  * Properly implements CRC values, including the pcrc32 on
	  each part of multipart archives, and a crc32 for the last part
	  of a multipart archive.
