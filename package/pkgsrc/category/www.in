	  the interpreter line at the top of the script from:
	  
	  #!${PREFIX}/bin/perl
	  
	  to
	  
	  #!${PREFIX}/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/bin/speedy
	  
	  After the script is initially run, instead of exiting, the perl interpreter
	  is kept running. During subsequent runs, this interpreter is used to handle
	  new executions instead of starting a new perl interpreter each time. A very
	  fast frontend program, written in C, is executed for each request. This fast
	  frontend then contacts the persistent Perl process, which is usually already
	  running, to do the work and return the results.

	  mod_authn_otp is an Apache web server module for two-factor authentication
	  using one-time passwords (OTP) generated via the HOTP/OATH algorithm
	  defined in RFC 4226. This creates a simple way to protect a web site with
	  one-time passwords, using any RFC 4226-compliant hardware or software

	  Apache module for external program authentication

	  The Apache HTTP Daemon can be configured to require users to supply logins
	  and passwords before accessing pages in some directories. Authentication is
	  the process of checking if the password given is correct for a user. Apache
	  has standard modules for authenticating out of several different kinds of
	  databases. The external authentication module provides a flexible tool for
	  creating authentication systems based on other databases.
	  
	  The module can be used in either of two somewhat divergent ways:
	  1) External Authentication:
	  
	  When a user supplies a login and password, mod_auth*_external runs a program
	  you write, passing it the login and password. Your program does whatever
	  checking and logging it needs to, and then returns a Accept/Reject flag to
	  Apache.
	  
	  2) Hardcoded Authentication:
	  
	  Some hooks have been inserted into mod_auth*_external to make it easy to
	  replace the call to the external authentication program with a call to a
	  hardcoded internal authentication routine that you write.

	  that you put in your site's cgi-bin/ directory, with no other dependencies. So
	  mimeTeX is very easy to install. And it's equally easy to use. Just place an

	  script if you're using Apache + mod_perl).
	  
	  CGI::Application is an Object-Oriented Perl module which implements an

	  Perl5 module for building HTML forms

	  The goal of CGI::FormBuilder is to provide an easy way to generate and
	  process CGI form-based applications. It is designed to be smart in that
	  it figures a lot of stuff out for you. As a result, FormBuilder gives
	  about a 4:1 ratio of the code it generates versus what you have to write.
	  
	  For example, if you have multiple values for a field, it sticks them
	  in a radio, checkbox, or select group, depending on some factors. It
	  will also automatically name fields for you in human-readable labels
	  depending on the field names, and lay everything out in a nicely
	  formatted table. It will even title the form based on the name of the
	  script itself (order_form.cgi becomes "Order Form").
	  
	  Plus, FormBuilder provides you full-blown validation for your fields,
	  including some useful builtin patterns. It will even generate
	  JavaScript validation routines on the fly! And, of course, it
	  maintains state ("stickiness") across submissions, with hooks provided
	  for you to plugin your own sessionid module such as Apache::Session.
	  
	  And though it's smart, it allows you to customize it as well. For
	  example, if you really want something to be a checkbox, you can make
	  it a checkbox. And, if you really want something to be output a
	  specific way, you can even specify the name of an HTML::Template or
	  Template Toolkit (Template) compatible template which will be
	  automatically filled in, statefully.

	  The ACL module currently only knows to exploit the private namespace. In

	  Perl5 module implementing a bare-bones HTML parser

	  This module is a bare-bones HTML parser.  It is similar in concept to
	  HTML::Parser, but it differs in a couple of important ways.
	  
	  First, HTML::SimpleParse just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it;
	  it does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does
	  distinguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting
	  tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on).
	  
	  Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
	  content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to
	  balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags
	  are inside other pairs of tags.
	  
	  Because of these characteristics, you can make a very effective HTML filter
	  by sub-classing HTML::SimpleParse.

	  Javascript Templating with Template Toolkit

	  Jemplate is a templating framework for Javascript that is built over

	  Jemplate parses TT2 templates using the TT2 Perl framework, but with a
	  twist.  Instead of compiling the templates into Perl code, it compiles
	  them into Javascript.  Jemplate then provides a Javascript runtime
	  module for processing the template code.  Combined with JSON and

	  * An amazing MVC web framework supporting a simplified single
	  file mode through Mojolicious::Lite.  Powerful out of the box
	  with RESTful routes, plugins, Perl-ish templates, session
	  management, signed cookies, testing framework, static file
	  server, I18N, first class unicode support and much more for
	  you to discover.
	  * Very clean, portable and Object Oriented pure Perl API without
	  any hidden magic and no requirements besides Perl 5.8.7.
	  * Full stack HTTP 1.1 and WebSocket client/server implementation
	  with IPv6, TLS, Bonjour, IDNA, Comet (long polling), chunking
	  and multipart support.
	  * Builtin async IO web server supporting epoll, kqueue, UNIX
	  domain sockets and hot deployment, perfect for embedding.
	  * Automatic CGI, FastCGI and PSGI detection.
	  * JSON and XML/HTML5 parser with CSS3 selector support.

	help
	  Object-oriented interfaces for HTML

	  The Rose::HTML::Object::* family of classes represent HTML tags,
	  or groups of tags. These objects allow HTML to be arbitrarily
	  manipulated, then serialized to actual HTML (or XHTML). Currently,
	  the process only works in one direction. Objects cannot be constructed
	  from their serialized representations. In practice, given the
	  purpose of these modules, this is not an important limitation.
	  
	  Any HTML tag can theoretically be represented by a
	  Rose::HTML::Object-derived class, but this family of modules was
	  originally motivated by a desire to simplify the use of HTML forms.
	  
	  The form/field object interfaces have been heavily abstracted to
	  allow for input and output filtering, inflation/deflation of values,
	  and compound fields (fields that contain other fields). The classes
	  are also designed to be subclassed. The creation of custom form
	  and field subclasses is really the "big win" for these modules.
	  
	  There is also a simple image tag class which is useful for
	  auto-populating the width and height attributes of img tags. Future
	  releases may include object representations of other HTML tags.
	  Contributions are welcome.

	help
	  URI class for easy and efficient manipulation of URI components

	  Rose::URI is an alternative to URI. Important differences include:
	  
	  Rose::URI provides a rich set of query string manipulation methods.
	  Query parameters can be added, removed, and checked for their
	  existence. URI allows the entire query to be set or returned as a
	  whole via the query_form or query methods, and the URI::QueryParam
	  module provides a few more methods for query string manipulation.
	  
	  Rose::URI supports query parameters with multiple values (e.g.
	  "a=1&a=2"). URI has limited support for this through query_form's
	  list return value. Better methods are available in URI::QueryParam.
	  
	  Rose::URI uses Apache's C-based URI parsing and HTML escaping
	  functions when running in a mod_perl 1.x web server environment.
	  
	  Rose::URI stores each URI "in pieces" (scheme, host, path, etc.)
	  and then assembles those pieces when the entire URI is needed as
	  a string. This technique is based on the assumption that the URI
	  will be manipulated many more times than it is stringified. If this
	  is not the case in your usage scenario, then URI may be a better
	  alternative.

	  * XHTML templates: contain no programming logic, only nodes tagged
	  with nevow attributes
	  * data/render methods: simplified MVC
	  * stan: An s-expression-like syntax for expressing xml in pure python
	  * formless: For describing the types of objects which may be passed
	  to methods of your classes, validating and coercing string input
	  from either web or command-line sources, and calling your methods
	  automatically once validation passes
	  * freeform: For rendering web forms based on formless type
	  descriptions, accepting form posts and passing them to formless
	  validators, and rendering
	  * error forms in the event validation fails
	  * livepage: Cross-browser JavaScript glue for sending client side

	  Two-step approach to web response generation

	  Action Pack splits the response to a web request into a controller
	  part (performing the logic) and a view part (rendering a template).
	  This two-step approach is known as an action, which will normally
	  create, read, update, or delete (CRUD for short) some sort of model
	  part (often backed by a database) before choosing either to render a
	  template or redirecting to another action.
	  
	  Action Pack implements these actions as public methods on Action
	  Controllers and uses Action Views to implement the template rendering.
	  Action Controllers are then responsible for handling all the actions
	  relating to a certain part of an application.  This grouping usually
	  consists of actions for lists and for CRUDs revolving around a single
	  (or a few) model objects.  So ContactController would be responsible
	  for listing contacts, creating, deleting, and updating contacts.  A
	  WeblogController could be responsible for both posts and comments.
	  
	  Action View templates are written using embedded Ruby in tags mingled
	  in with the HTML.  To avoid cluttering the templates with code, a
	  bunch of helper classes provide common behavior for forms, dates, and
	  strings.  And it's easy to add specific helpers to keep the separation
	  as the application evolves.

	  It's translated to well-formatted, standard CSS
	  using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.
	  
	  Sass has two syntaxes. The new main syntax (as of Sass 3)
	  is known as "SCSS" (for "Sassy CSS"),

	  This means that every valid CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS as well.
	  SCSS files use the extension `.scss`.
	  
	  The second, older syntax is known as the indented syntax (or just "Sass").
	  Inspired by Haml's terseness, it's intended for people
	  who prefer conciseness over similarity to CSS.
	  Instead of brackets and semicolons,
	  it uses the indentation of lines to specify blocks.
	  Although no longer the primary syntax,

	  posts, and basic content management. You can add WMD to any textarea
	  with one line of code. Add live preview with one line more. WMD
	  works in nearly all modern browsers, and is now completely free to
	  use. The next release will be open source under an MIT-style license.
	  
	  This is not a WYSIWYG editor. Writing HTML to look a certain way
	  can make your text less accessible to blind people, search engines,
	  mobile users, and feed readers. HTML describes a document's logical
	  structure -- not its appearance. It just wasn't built for WYSIWYG.
	  
	  So WMD is something new: a Wysiwym Markdown editor.

	  Web Meta Language

	  WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation
	  toolkit.  It consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends
	  in a sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme.  Each backend provides
	  one particular core language.  For maximum power WML additionally ships
	  with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level
	  features build on top of the backend core languages.  While not trivial
	  and idiot proof WML provides most of the core features real hackers
	  always wanted for HTML generation.

	  Lightweight http proxy, helps IPv4 only browsers

	  This is a little WWW-proxy that can communicate over both IPv4 and IPv6. Its
	  primary use is as stub-proxy between a IPv4-only browser and the rest of the
	  (v4 and v6) Internet. This proxy is meant to run on a client machine as
	  frontend to an IPv4-only browser and not to serve a large number of clients.
	  If you need the latter you're much better off with a full-fledged proxy like
	  squid.
	  
	  This program is based on code copyrighted by the Junkbusters Corp.

	  Graphical access counter, clock and date indicator for WWW pages

	  The Count program is a standard CGI program to count raw access hits in web
	  pages. This is a graphic counter, that means it only counts if the browser
	  support graphics.  It keeps the hits in text files. The program tries to
	  maintain data integrity by locking the datafile. Among its many features,
	  it also can be used to show time, date (of any timezone in the world),
	  and countdown to a date. This single program can be used for any number
	  of web pages, for any number of users.

	  High perfomance HTTP 1.1 webserver written in Erlang

	  Yaws is a HTTP high perfomance 1.1 webserver particularly well suited for
	  dynamic-content webapplications. Two separate modes of operations are
	  supported:
	  * Standalone mode where Yaws runs as a regular webserver daemon.
	  This is the default mode.
	  * Embedded mode where Yaws runs as an embedded webserver in another
	  erlang application.
	  
	  Yaws is entirely written in Erlang furthermore it is a multithreaded webserver
	  where one Erlang light weight process is used to handle each client.
	  
	  The main advantages of yaws compared to other Web technologies are performance
	  and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying Erlang system and its
	  ability to handle concurrent processes in an efficent way. Its elegance comes
	  from Erlang as well. Web applications dont have to be written in ugly adhoc
	  languages.
