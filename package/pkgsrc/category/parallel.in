	  Clustering package for unix

	  This is a collection of clustering tools, to turn your ordinary
	  everyday pile of UNIX workstations into a speedy parallel beast.
	  
	  Initially this work was based on the work of IBM's PSSP, and copied
	  heavily from the ideas there.  Its also lightly based on the work
	  pioneered in GLUnix.

	  Distributed queueing system

	  The Distributed Queueing System is designed as a management tool to
	  aid in computational resource distribution across a network.  DQS
	  provides architecture transparency for both users and administration
	  across a heterogeneous environment, allowing for seamless interaction
	  for multiple architectures.  Highly mutable custom site configurations
	  are possible under DQS.  This ability to customize DQS leads to
	  effective resource distribution and increased network throughput.

	help
	  Ganglia cluster monitor, monitoring daemon

	  Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance
	  computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical
	  design targeted at federations of clusters. It relies on a multicast-based
	  listen/announce protocol to monitor state within clusters and uses a tree of
	  point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to federate
	  clusters and aggregate their state. It leverages widely used technologies such
	  as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and
	  RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data
	  structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high
	  concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set
	  of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on
	  over 500 clusters around the world. It has been used to link clusters across
	  university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle clusters with
	  2000 nodes.
	  
	  You may wish to install www/ganglia-webfrontend to monitor your systems via
	  the web.

	  of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including
	  NUMA memory nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and
	  simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers various system
	  attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the

	  The virtual machine can be composed of hosts of varying types, in
	  physically remote locations. PVM applications can be composed of any
	  number of separate processes, or components, written in a mixture of C,
	  C++ and Fortran. The system is portable to a wide variety of
	  architectures, including workstations, multiprocessors, supercomputers and

	  PVM is a byproduct of ongoing research at several institutions, and is
	  made available to the public free of charge.
