	  ISO 9660 images for all the binary packages in a specified
	  directory.
	  
	  A choice of two algorithms is available for how the packages
	  are grouped.  The "no duplication" algorithm arranges the

	  its dependencies on CD/DVD numbers 1 through `n'.
	  
	  The "no inter-CD/DVD depends" algorithm will place certain
	  packages on more than one CD/DVD to ensure that each CD/DVD is
	  self contained (all package dependencies are satisfied within
	  the single CD/DVD).

config BR2_PKGSRC_PACKAGE_PKGTOOLS_PKGDEPGRAPH
	bool "pkgdepgraph-2.8"
	help
	  Visual representation of installed NetBSD packages

	  pkgdepgraph prints out a "dot" language specification of the
	  inter-dependencies of your installed packages.  The "dot" language
	  is interpreted by the graphviz package to make graphs.  There are
	  several uses for such information.
	  
	  (1) A graphical representation of information is always good to
	  look at.
	  
	  (2) The output itself can be sorted and filtered to provide a list
	  of packages to delete in order that they can be rebuilt (to replace
	  out-of-date components).
	  
	  (3) You can visually estimate the work involved in (or impact of)
	  removing a given component in order to replace it.

config BR2_PKGSRC_PACKAGE_PKGTOOLS_PKGDIFF
	bool "pkgdiff-1.3"
	help
	  Tools to create, maintain, and send back patches for pkgsrc

	  This package contains four tools to ease creating and maintaining
	  patches for pkgsrc: mkpatches, patchdiff, pkgdiff, and pkgvi.
	  
	  pkgdiff compares two files (like diff) and produces an output file
	  that can be used in pkgsrc.
	  
	  mkpatches automatically generates a set of patches, if the original
	  versions of the files had been saved as filename.orig.
	  
	  patchdiff compares a previously existing set of patches with another
	  one created by mkpatches, and outputs any changes.
	  
	  pkgvi makes backup copies if a file is changed, so pkgdiff can be run
	  on it later, generating a patch for the changes made.

	  for various things that the used languages cannot detect, for example
	  application-specific restrictions on certain variables.
	  
	  Before importing a new package or making changes to an existing package,
	  pkglint should be run in the package's directory to check for common
	  errors.

	  rcorder is designed to print out a dependency ordering of a set of

config BR2_PKGSRC_PACKAGE_PKGTOOLS_RDIGEST
	bool "rdigest-20111104"
	help
	  Recursive message digest wrapper utility

	  This utility is a wrapper for the md5(3), sha1(3), rmd160(3), and
	  tiger hash routines.  It is remarkably similar to the digest package,
	  except that it can recursively checksum directory trees.
	  
	  While a simple checksum on a tar file is usually satisfactory, once
	  said archive has been extracted, it is virtually impossible to
	  repackage the extracted tree in a form that can yield a repeatable
	  checksum.  To be specific, changes in timestamps and ownership, and
	  changes in file ordering within directories can affect the checksum of
	  the archive, while not really impacting the actual code at all.
	  
	  The algorithm used to checksum a directory in this implementation
	  is considers only the files' pathnames, the files' types (ie,
	  directory vs.  file vs. symbolic link), and their contents (for
	  the latter two).  It is described in greater detail in the man
	  page.

config BR2_PKGSRC_PACKAGE_PKGTOOLS_SHLOCK
	bool "shlock-20080529"
	help
	  Shell utility to perform dot-locking

	  The shlock command can create or verify a lock file on behalf of a
	  shell or other script program.  When it attempts to create a lock
	  file, if one already exists, shlock verifies that it is or is not
	  valid.  If valid, shlock will exit with a non-zero exit code.  If
	  invalid, shlock will re- move the lock file, and create a new one.
	  
	  shlock uses the rename(2) system call to make the final target lock
	  file, which is an atomic operation (i.e.  "dot locking", so named for
	  this mech- anism's original use for locking system mailboxes).  It
	  puts the process ID ("PID") from the command line into the requested
	  lock file.
	  
	  shlock verifies that an extant lock file is still valid by using
	  kill(2) with a zero signal to check for the existence of the process
	  that holds the lock.

	  


config BR2_PKGSRC_PACKAGE_PKGTOOLS_TINDERBOX_DRAGONFLY
	bool "tinderbox-dragonfly-3.4.1nb2"
	help
	  

	  Tinderbox is a package building system for FreeBSD that has been modified
	  for use on pkgsrc on DragonFly BSD.  Joe Marcus Clarke is the author.
	  
	  One can define multiple jails (base system versions) and multiple portstrees
	  (portstree = pkgsrc tree).  The combination of jail and portstree is called
	  a build.  A Tinderbox jail is not what is understood as a jail in *BSD, it
	  is in fact a given world in a chroot.  Tinderbox supports automatic tracking
	  of dependencies and only rebuilds packages that changed since last run.
	  Tinderbox has support for email notification of failed builds.
	  
	  Tinderbox is designed to easily provide package sets of needed ports for
	  specific platforms and architectures.  Tinderbox is an excellent tool for
	  testing new packages and package upgrades, especially for testing
	  dependencies and packing lists.  It is also useful for testing packages on
	  previous releases of *BSD since it's possible to run a previous release
	  world inside a jail on a current release host.

	  verifypc is a tool that sanity checks the dependencies of a package based on
	  the results of a successful build, assuming the package uses pkg-config to
	  detect dependencies.
	  
	  verifypc will warn you if the configuration script requests an uninstalled
	  or unavailable package (not specified as a direct dependency) or if the
	  requested package does not match the version specification in the packages'
	  dependencies.

	  It is intended for use by buildlink code to cleanly separate out the true

	  Xpkgwedge, not a "real" program in the traditional sense, is a hack that
	  allows users to compile X11 pkgs from pkgsrc and install them outside of
	  the X11 tree - even if they use imake - by using pkgxmkmf.
	  
	  Pkgxmkmf is a slightly modified xmkmf from the X11R6.3 release and supports
	  finding config files in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/X11/config, if it exists, and in
	  ${X11BASE}/lib/X11/config.  In all other respects, it is identical to xmkmf.
	  Please refer to xmkmf(1) for more information.
