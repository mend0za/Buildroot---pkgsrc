	  System hardening tool focusing on educating the user

	  Bastille is a system hardening / lockdown program which enhances the
	  security of a Unix host.  It configures daemons, system settings and
	  firewalls to be more secure.  It can shut off unneeded services like rcp
	  and rlogin, and helps create "chroot jails" that help limit the
	  vulnerability of common Internet services like Web services and DNS.
	  
	  This tool currently hardens Red Hat (Fedora Core, Enterprise and
	  Legacy/Classic), SuSE, Debian, Gentoo, Mandrake Linux, HP-UX, Mac OS X
	  and Turbo Linux.
	  
	  If run in the preferred interactive mode, it can teach you a good deal
	  about  security while personalizing your system security state.
	  
	  Bastille can also assess and report on the state of a system, which may
	  serve as an aid to security administrators, auditors and system
	  administrators who wish to investigate the state of their system's
	  hardening without making changes to such.  This assessment functionality
	  has only been tested on Red Hat Linux (Fedora, Legacy, Enterprise) and
	  SUSE systems.

	  GTK frontend for systrace.
	  
	  Systrace enforces system call policies for applications by constraining
	  the application's access to the system.  The policy is generated
	  interactively. Operations not covered by the policy raise an alarm
	  and allow an user to refine the currently configured policy.
	  
	  For complicated applications, it is difficult to know the correct
	  policy before running them.  Initially, Systrace notifies the user
	  about all system calls that an applications tries to execute.  The
	  user configures a policy for the specific system call that caused
	  the warning.  After a few minutes, a policy is generated that allows
	  the application to run without any warnings.  However, events that
	  are not covered still generate a warning.  Normally, that is an
	  indication of a security problem.  Systrace improves cyber security
	  by providing intrusion prevention.
	  
	  With systrace untrusted binary applications can be sandboxed.
	  Their access to the system can be restricted almost arbitrarily.
	  Sandboxing applications available only as binaries is only sensible
	  as it is not possible to directly analyze what they are designed
	  to do.  However, constraining the system calls large open-source
	  applications are allowed to execute is useful too as it is very
	  difficult to determine their correctness.
	  
	  System call arguments can be rewritten dynamically.  This effects
	  a virtual chroot for the sandboxed application.  It also prevents
	  race conditions in the argument evaluation.

	  passphrase before being embedded
	  - Encoding rate: 1/110
	  
	  Primary uses for Hydan:
	  - Covert Communication:  embedding data into binaries creates a
	  covert channel that can be used to exchange secret messages.
	  - Signing:  a program's cryptographic signature can be embedded
	  into itself.  The recipient of the binary can then verify
	  that it has not been tampered with (virus or trojan), and is
	  really from who it claims to be from.  This check can be
	  built into the OS for user transparency.
	  - Watermarking:  a watermark can be embedded to uniquely
	  identify binaries for copyright purposes, or as part of a DRM
	  scheme.  Note:  this usage is not recommended as Hydan
	  implements fragile watermarks.

	  Crypto algorithms library

	  Libmcrypt:
	  
	  libmcrypt is the library which implements all the algorithms and
	  modes found in mcrypt. It is currently under development but it
	  seems to work pretty good.  Unlike most encryption libraries
	  libmcrypt does not have everything (random number generators,
	  hashes, hmac implementation, key exchange, public key encryption
	  etc.).  Libmcrypt only implements an interface to access block and
	  stream encryption algorithms. Its purpose was to assist in the
	  development of mcrypt by providing a uniform interface to access
	  several different encryption algorithms, so that the main program
	  is independent of the encryption algorithms and the modes used.
	  
	  Libmcrypt supports the algorithms:
	  BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES, 3-WAY, SAFER-sk64, SAFER-sk128,
	  SAFER+, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6, MARS, IDEA, RIJNDAEL-128 (AES),
	  RIJNDAEL-192, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, CAST-128 (known as CAST5),
	  CAST-256, ARCFOUR and WAKE.  Block algorithms can be used in: CBC,
	  ECB, CFB and OFB (8 bit and n bit, where n is the size of the

	  OAuth allows users to hand out tokens instead of usernames and

	  token grants access to a specific site (e.g.  a video editing site)
	  for specific resources (e.g.  just videos from a specific album) and
	  for a defined duration (e.g.  the next 2 hours).
	  
	  Thus OAuth allows a user to grant a third party site access to their
	  information stored with another service provider, without sharing
	  their access permissions or the full extent of their data.
	  
	  OAuth is a service that is complementary to but distinct from OpenID.

	  Mixminion is a communication security application for electronic mail

	  It does this by sending messages through a series of servers.
	  Messages going into and out of each server are encrypted.  Each server
	  keeps a pool of messages.  When a message comes in it is placed in the
	  pool.  Messages sent out from the pool are difficult to correlate with
	  the messages going in.  This process is called "mixing."
	  
	  Each server reduces the ability of the adversary to determine the
	  origin of a message.  Chaining the servers further reduces this
	  ability and contains the damage caused by compromised servers.  The
	  chain of servers is chosen by the Mixminion software running on the

	  PGP signing, verification, encryption and decryption program

	  The netpgp library is a BSD-licensed library for managing PGP keys.
	  
	  On top of the library, the netpgp command can digitally sign files and
	  verify that the signatures attached to files were signed by a given
	  user identifier.  netpgp can also encrypt files using the public or
	  private keys of users and, in the same manner, decrypt files which
	  were encrypted.
	  
	  The netpgpkeys utility can also be used to generate a new key-pair for
	  a user.  This key is in two parts, the public key (which can be used
	  by other people) and a private key.
	  
	  In addition to these primary uses, the third way of using netpgp is to
	  maintain keyrings.  Keyrings are collections of public keys belonging
	  to other users.  By using other means of identification, it is
	  possible to establish the bona fides of other users.  Once trust has
	  been established, the public key of the other user will be signed.
	  The other user's public key can be added to our keyring.  The other
	  user will add our public key to their keyring.

	help
	  Cryptographic library

	  Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more
	  or less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages
	  (C++, Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in
	  kernel space. In most contexts, you need more than the basic
	  cryptographic algorithms, you also need some way to keep track of available
	  algorithms, their properties and variants. You often have some algorithm
	  selection process, often dictated by a protocol you want to implement.
	  
	  And as the requirements of applications differ in subtle and not so
	  subtle ways, an API that fits one application well can be a pain to use
	  in a different context. And that is why there are so many different
	  cryptographic libraries around.
	  
	  Nettle tries to avoid this problem by doing one thing, the low-level
	  crypto stuff, and providing a simple but general interface to it.
	  In particular, Nettle doesn't do algorithm selection. It doesn't do
	  memory allocation. It doesn't do any I/O.
	  
	  The idea is that one can build several application and context specific
	  interfaces on top of Nettle, and share the code, test cases, benchmarks,
	  documentation, etc. Examples are the Nettle module for the Pike
	  language, and LSH, which both use an object-oriented abstraction on top
	  of the library.

	  the key setup very expensive. ("Eks" stands for "expensive key
	  schedule".) This doesn't make it significantly cryptographically
	  stronger, but is intended to hinder brute-force attacks. It also
	  makes it unsuitable for any application requiring key agility. It
	  was designed by Niels Provos and David Mazieres for password hashing
	  in OpenBSD. See Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt for the hash algorithm.
	  See Crypt::Eksblowfish::Blowfish for the unmodified Blowfish cipher.
	  
	  Eksblowfish is a parameterised (family-keyed) cipher. It takes a
	  cost parameter that controls how expensive the key scheduling is.
	  It also takes a family key, known as the "salt". Cost and salt
	  parameters together define a cipher family. Within each family, a
	  key determines an encryption function in the usual way. See
	  Crypt::Eksblowfish::Family for a way to encapsulate an Eksblowfish

	  After using ezPyCrypto myself, I found that while it performed ok with
	  smaller public key sizes, it proved impossibly slow with larger keys.
	  This slowness, resulting from non-optimal code in its backend (the
	  Python Cryptography Toolkit) meant that on a 1.5 GHz Athlon XP, it was
	  taking several minutes to generate 4096-bit keys.  Completely
	  unacceptable if you need real security.
	  
	  Performance is absolutely critical for an encryption API.  If slowness
	  deters people from using adequate-sized keys, security will be
	  severely compromised, almost to the extent that there's little point
	  in using encryption in the first place.

	  Whenever data structures are described in some machine and programming

	  which are called 'concrete' or 'transfer' syntaxes.
	  
	  Abstract syntaxes appear useful in networking as a tool for engineering
	  protocols in a clear and portable way. Moreover, once a protocol is
	  described in some abstract language, protocol parsers and builders
	  could be automatically generated for various computing
	  architectures/programming languages, thus saving engineers from
	  implementing low-level transport details by hand.
	  
	  Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a set of ITU standards
	  defining particular implementation of abstract data description
	  language accompanied by a collection of transfer encoding methods.
	  Perhaps the most widely used among these data serialization methods
	  is Basic Encoding Rules (BER) together with its derivatives (DER and

	  OpenBSD's bcrypt() password hashing algorithm for Ruby

	  == Why you should use bcrypt
	  
	  If you store user passwords in the clear, then an attacker who steals
	  a copy of your database has a giant list of emails and passwords. Some
	  of your users will only have one password -- for their email account,
	  for their banking account, for your application. A simple hack could
	  escalate into massive identity theft.
	  
	  It's your responsibility as a web developer to make your web
	  application secure -- blaming your users for not being security
	  experts is not a professional response to risk.
	  
	  bcrypt allows you to easily harden your application against these
	  kinds of attacks.

	  Monitor and filter incoming requests for network services

	  The tcp_wrappers package allows you to monitor and filter incoming
	  requests for the SYSTAT, FINGER, FTP, TELNET, RLOGIN, RSH, EXEC, TFTP,
	  TALK, and other network services. It provides tiny daemon wrapper
	  programs that can be installed without any changes to existing
	  software or to existing configuration files. The wrappers report the
	  name of the client host and of the requested service. The wrappers do
	  not exchange information with the client or server applications, and
	  impose no overhead on the actual conversation between the client and
	  server applications.

	help
	  Programs to aid post-mortem after a break-in

	  TCT is a collection of programs by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema for a
	  post-mortem analysis of a UNIX system after break-in.
	  
	  Notable TCT components are the grave-robber tool that captures
	  information, the ils and mactime tools that display access patterns of
	  files dead or alive, the unrm and lazarus tools that recover deleted
	  files, and the findkey tool that recovers cryptographic keys from a
	  running process or from files.
	  
	  WARNING
	  
	  This software is not for the faint of heart.  It is relatively
	  unpolished compared to the software that Dan and Wietse usually
	  release.  TCT can spend a lot of time collecting data.  And although
	  TCT collects lots of data, many analysis tools still need to be
	  written.

	  Username and password manager that uses the Tk toolkit

	  TkPasMan is a simple program that lets you store usernames and passwords
	  you collect during access to forums, mailing lists, and other websites.
	  It is inspired in gpasman, but it has more paste possibilities. You can,
	  for example, paste the username at first and then password, using two
	  mouse clicks.
	  
	  Passwords can be stored in a secure file, using OpenSSL to encrypt it.

	  File and directory integrity checker

	  Tripwire is a file and directory integrity checker, a utility that
	  compares a designated set of files and directories against information
	  stored in a previously generated database.  Any differences are
	  flagged and logged, including added or deleted entries.  When run
	  against system files on a regular basis, any changes in critical
	  system files will be spotted -- and appropriate damage control
	  measures can be taken immediately.  With Tripwire, system
	  administrators can conclude with a high degree of certainty that a
	  given set of files remain free of unauthorized modifications if
	  Tripwire reports no changes.
