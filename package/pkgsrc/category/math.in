	  Statistical language for data analysis and graphics

	  R is a language which bears a passing resemblance to the S language
	  developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories.  It provides support for a
	  variety of statistical and graphical analyses.  R is a true
	  computer language which contains a number of control-flow
	  constructions for iteration and alternation.  It allows users to
	  add additional functionality by defining new functions.  On
	  platforms which support the dlopen (3) interface, Fortran and C
	  code can be linked and called at run time.
	  
	  R is very close to S in both syntax and semantics, but is not identical.
	  Whether this is a bug or feature is an open question.

	  Otherwise it enters interactive mode. In this mode, it accepts
	  commands one at a time, processes them, and displays the answers.
	  In the simplest case, commands are simply expressions which are
	  evaluated. For example, he following line can be input:
	  > 3 * (4 + 1)
	  and the calculator will print 15.
	  
	  Commands are statements in a C-like language, where each input line
	  is treated as the body of a procedure. Thus he copmmand line can
	  contain variable declarations, expressions, labels, conditional
	  tests, and loops. Assignments to any variable name will automatically

	  C++ template library for linear algebra

	  Eigen 2 is a C++ template library for linear algebra: vectors, matrices, and
	  related algorithms. It is:
	  * Versatile. Eigen handles, without code duplication, and in a completely
	  integrated way:
	  o both fixed-size and dynamic-size matrices and vectors.
	  o both dense and sparse (the latter is still experimental) matrices and
	  vectors.
	  o both plain matrices/vectors and abstract expressions.
	  o both column-major (the default) and row-major matrix storage.
	  o both basic matrix/vector manipulation and many more advanced, specialized
	  modules providing algorithms for linear algebra, geometry, quaternions,
	  or advanced array manipulation.
	  * Fast.
	  o Expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable
	  lazy evaluation, when that is appropriate -- Eigen takes care of this
	  automatically and handles aliasing too in most cases.
	  o Explicit vectorization is performed for the SSE (2 and later) and AltiVec
	  instruction sets, with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code.
	  Expression templates allow to perform these optimizations globally for
	  whole expressions.
	  o With fixed-size objects, dynamic memory allocation is avoided, and the
	  loops are unrolled when that makes sense.
	  o For large matrices, special attention is paid to cache-friendliness.
	  * Elegant. The API is extremely clean and expressive, thanks to expression
	  templates. Implementing an algorithm on top of Eigen feels like just copying
	  pseudocode. You can use complex expressions and still rely on Eigen to
	  produce optimized code: there is no need for you to manually decompose
	  expressions into small steps.
	  * Compiler-friendy. Eigen has very reasonable compilation times at least with
	  GCC, compared to other C++ libraries based on expression templates and heavy
	  metaprogramming. Eigen is also standard C++ and supports various compilers.

	  In contrast to Graphviz and other graph optimizers, graphopt does
	  not use a heuristic approach to layout optimization.  Instead, it
	  uses basic principles of physics to iteratively determine optimal
	  layout.  Each node is given mass and an electric charge, and each
	  edge is represented as a spring.  Node mass, electric charge,
	  optimal spring length, and the spring constant are tweakable in
	  the gui in realtime.
	  
	  For most graphs, this is all that is needed - hit 'go' and the
	  graph organizes itself much as the analagous real-life system would
	  if constrained to two dimensions.  For more complex graphs, some
	  fiddling with the physical parameters at different stages of
	  optimization usually does the trick.
	  
	  To accomodate very large graphs, an additional mechanism called
	  layering was added.  When a graph is loaded, nodes are assigned to
	  layers based on their relative positions.  During optimization,
	  you can choose to hide any number of layers.  Any nodes assigned
	  to a layer lower than the selected layer are not only hidden, but
	  neither their electric charges nor the forces of the springs attached
	  to them are figured into the forces acting on the visible nodes.
	  In effect, those nodes cease to exist, and a smaller graph is
	  allowed to lay itself out without being constrained by an excessive
	  number of nodes.

	  - Other devices, such as terminals and dot-matrix printers, are

	  if the underlying device supports them.
	  - Output can be directed to multiple devices at once and

	  - All this can be done on any operating system that PSPP supports.
	  Though the latest versions of what PSPP replaces support similar
	  functionality, they do so only under non-free Microsoft
	  operating systems.
	  * Portability: PSPP is easy to port. It should be simple to port it
	  to any operating system having an ANSI C compiler.
