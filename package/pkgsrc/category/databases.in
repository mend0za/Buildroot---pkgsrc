	  DB2 and generic ODBC. The Sybase, Informix and PostgreSQL drivers are community
	  contributions. We hope more people will contribute drivers to support more
	  databases.
	  
	  Unique Features of ADOdb
	  - Easy for Windows programmers to understand. Makes porting ASP code to PHP
	  easy because many of the conventions are similar to Microsoft's ADO.
	  - We provide support code to handle inserts and updates which can be adapted
	  to multiple databases quickly. Methods are provided for date handling,
	  string concatenation and string quoting characters for differing databases.
	  - A metatype system is built in so that we can figure out that types such as
	  CHAR, TEXT and STRING are equivalent in different databases.
	  - Easy to port because all the database dependent code are stored in stub
	  functions. You do not need to port the core logic of the classes.
	  - SQL to popup menu (<SELECT>) support included
	  - PHP4 Session support.

	  Persistent database generator for high performance C applications

	  DataDraw is an ultra-fast persistent database for high performance programs

	  DataDraw database, even while being manipulated in inner loops of compute
	  intensive applications.  DataDraw databases are compiled, and directly link
	  into your C programs.  DataDraw databases are resident in memory, making data
	  manipulation even faster than if they were stored in native C data structures
	  (really).
	  
	  DataDraw databases can be persistent.  Modifications to persistent data are
	  written to disk as they are made, which of course dramatically slows write
	  times.  However, DataDraw databases can also be volatile.  Volatile databases
	  exist only in memory, and only for the duration that your program needs it.
	  Volatile databases can be directly manipulated faster than C structures, since
	  data is better organized in memory to optimize cache performance
	  
	  DataDraw supports modular design.  An application can have one or more common
	  persistent databases, and multiple volatile databases to support various tools'
	  data structures.  Classes in a tool's database can extend classes in the common
	  database.
	  
	  DataDraw is also 64-bit optimized, allowing programs to run much faster and in
	  less memory than standard C programs using 64-bit pointers.  This is because
	  DataDraw databases supports over 4 billion objects of a given class with 32-bit
	  object references.

	  Java interface to Sleepycat Software's Berkeley DB version 3

	  Berkeley DB is an embeddable database system that supports keyed access to
	  data. The software is distributed in source code form, and developers can
	  compile and link the source code into a single library for inclusion
	  directly in their applications.
	  
	  Developers may choose to store data in any of several different storage
	  structures to satisfy the requirements of a particular application. In
	  database terminology, these storage structures and the code that operates on
	  them are called access methods. The library includes support for the
	  following access methods:
	  
	  * B+tree: Stores keys in sorted order, using either a programmer-supplied
	  ordering function or a default function that does lexicographical
	  ordering of keys. Applications may perform equality or range searches.
	  * Hashing: Stores records in a hash table for fast searches based on
	  strict equality. Extended Linear Hashing modifies the hash function
	  used by the table as new records are inserted, in order to keep buckets
	  underfull in the steady state.
	  * Fixed and Variable-Length Records: Stores fixed- or variable-length
	  records in sequential order. Record numbers may be immutable or
	  mutable, i.e., permitting new records to be inserted between existing
	  records or requiring that new records be added only at the end of the
	  database.

	  employs a set of thin wrappers around different cipher modules to provide

	  EncodedColumn supports having more than one encoded column per table
	  and each column can use a different cipher.
	  Encode adds only one item to the namespace of the object utilizing it
	  (_column_encoders).
	  
	  There is, unfortunately, some features that EncodedColumn doesn't support.
	  DigestColumns supports changing certain options at runtime, as well as the

	  2) a set of software sockets where any author can plug in any storage
	  mechanism.
	  
	  There are three main uses for SQL::Statement.
	  1) to access and manipulate data in CSV, XML, and other formats
	  2) to build a DBD for a new data source

	  The server features high concurrency due to thread-pool modeled implementation
	  and the epoll/kqueue mechanism of the modern Linux/*BSD kernel. The server and
	  its clients communicate with each other by simple binary protocol on TCP/IP.
	  Protocols compatible with memcached and HTTP/1.1 are also supported so that

	  - isn
	  - ltree
	  - lo
	  - uuid-ossp
	  - unaccent
	  
	  The "citext" module provides a case-insensitive character string type,
	  citext. Essentially, it internally calls lower when comparing values.
	  Otherwise, it behaves almost exactly like text.
	  
	  The "hstore" module implements the "hstore" data type for storing sets
	  of key/value pairs within a single PostgreSQL value. This can be useful
	  in various scenarios, such as rows with many attributes that are rarely
	  examined, or semi-structured data. Keys and values are simply text strings.
	  
	  The "intarray" module provides a number of useful functions and operators
	  for manipulating one-dimensional arrays of integers. There is also support
	  for indexed searches using some of the operators.
	  
	  The "isn" module provides data types for the following international
	  product numbering standards: EAN13, UPC, ISBN (books), ISMN (music),
	  and ISSN (serials). Numbers are validated on input, and correctly
	  hyphenated on output.
	  
	  The "ltree" module implements a data type ltree for representing
	  labels of data stored in a hierarchical tree-like structure.
	  Extensive facilities for searching through label trees are provided.
	  
	  The "lo" module provides support for managing Large Objects (also called
	  LOs or BLOBs). This includes a data type "lo" and a trigger "lo_manage."
	  
	  The "uuid-ossp" module provides functions to generate universally unique
	  identifiers (UUIDs) using one of several standard algorithms. There are
	  also functions to produce certain special UUID constants.
	  
	  "unaccent" is a text search dictionary that removes accents (diacritic signs)
	  from lexemes. It's a filtering dictionary, which means its output is always
	  passed to the next dictionary (if any), unlike the normal behavior of
	  dictionaries. This allows accent-insensitive processing for full text search.

	  un-optimized queries in large applications.
	  
	  The "pg_buffercache" module provides a means for examining what's

	  - hstore
	  - intarray
	  - isn
	  - ltree
	  - lo
	  - uuid-ossp
	  - unaccent
	  
	  The "citext" module provides a case-insensitive character string type,
	  citext. Essentially, it internally calls lower when comparing values.
	  Otherwise, it behaves almost exactly like text.
	  
	  The "hstore" module implements the "hstore" data type for storing sets
	  of key/value pairs within a single PostgreSQL value. This can be useful
	  in various scenarios, such as rows with many attributes that are rarely
	  examined, or semi-structured data. Keys and values are simply text strings.
	  
	  The "intarray" module provides a number of useful functions and operators
	  for manipulating one-dimensional arrays of integers. There is also support
	  for indexed searches using some of the operators.
	  
	  The "isn" module provides data types for the following international
	  product numbering standards: EAN13, UPC, ISBN (books), ISMN (music),
	  and ISSN (serials). Numbers are validated on input, and correctly
	  hyphenated on output.
	  
	  The "ltree" module implements a data type ltree for representing
	  labels of data stored in a hierarchical tree-like structure.
	  Extensive facilities for searching through label trees are provided.
	  
	  The "lo" module provides support for managing Large Objects (also called
	  LOs or BLOBs). This includes a data type "lo" and a trigger "lo_manage."
	  
	  The "uuid-ossp" module provides functions to generate universally unique
	  identifiers (UUIDs) using one of several standard algorithms. There are
	  also functions to produce certain special UUID constants.
	  
	  "unaccent" is a text search dictionary that removes accents (diacritic signs)
	  from lexemes. It's a filtering dictionary, which means its output is always
	  passed to the next dictionary (if any), unlike the normal behavior of
	  dictionaries. This allows accent-insensitive processing for full text search.

	  psycopg are that it supports (well... *will* support) the full Python
	  DBAPI-2.0 and being thread safe at level 2.
	  
	  psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
	  for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
	  cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
	  Every open Python connection keeps a pool of real (UNIX or TCP/IP) connections
	  to the database. Every time a new cursor is created, a new connection does not
	  need to be opened; instead one of the unused connections from the pool is
	  used. That makes psycopg very fast in typical client-server applications that
	  create a servicing thread every time a client request arrives.
	  
	  This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the original code to provide
	  new-style classes for connection and cursor objects and other
	  sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the aim of

	  Object-relation mapping put on rails

	  wrapping.  It is an implementation of the object-relational mapping
	  (ORM) pattern by the same name as described by Martin Fowler:
	  
	  "An object that wraps a row in a database table or view, encapsulates
	  the database access, and adds domain logic on that data."
	  
	  Active Records main contribution to the pattern is to relieve the
	  original of two stunting problems: lack of associations and
	  inheritance.  By adding a simple domain language-like set of macros to
	  describe the former and integrating the Single Table Inheritance
	  pattern for the latter, Active Record narrows the gap of functionality
	  between the data mapper and active record approach.

	  DataMapper plugin allowing the creation of nested sets from data models

	  DataMapper plugin allowing the creation of nested sets from data models.
	  Provides all the same functionality as dm-is-tree, plus tons more! Read on.
	  
	  == What is a nested set?
	  
	  Nested set is a clever model for storing hierarchical data in a flat table.
	  Instead of (only) storing the id of the parent on each node, a nested set puts
	  all nodes in a clever structure (see Example below). That is what makes it
	  possible to get the all of the descendants (not only immediate children),
	  ancestors, or siblings, in one single query to the database.
	  
	  The only downside to nested sets (compared to trees] is that the queries it
	  takes to know these things, and to move nodes around in the tree are rather
	  complex. That is what this plugin takes care of (+ lots of other neat stuff)!
	  
	  Nested sets are a good choice for most kinds of ordered trees with more than
	  two levels of nesting. Very good for menus, categories, and threaded posts.

	  == Why is this plugin useful?
	  
	  Your DataMapper resource might benefit from a state machine if it:
	  
	  * has different "modes" of operation
	  * has discrete behaviors
	  * especially if the behaviors are mutually exclusive
