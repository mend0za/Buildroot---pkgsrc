	  It was derived from a project called MCF, but differentiates from it
	  significantly.  It is based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language),
	  a binary derivative of XML.
	  
	  Matroska is designed with the future in mind. It incorporates features
	  you would expect from a modern container format, like:
	  
	  - Streamable over internet (HTTP and RTP)
	  - Fast seeking in the file
	  - High error recovery
	  - Menus (like DVDs have)
	  - Chapter entries
	  - Selectable subtitle streams
	  - Selectable audio streams
	  - Modularly extendable
