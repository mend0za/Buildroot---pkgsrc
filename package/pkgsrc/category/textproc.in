	  allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
	  format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
	  
	  The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make
	  it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
	  document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
	  like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
	  Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
	  filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown's
	  syntax is the format of plain text email.

	  applications (Office 2007 / 2003 / XP version) to allow for opening

	  that adheres to ODF 1.0 specifications. We also provide command
	  line translator utilities that allow doing batch conversions.
	  
	  The converter is based on XSL transformations between two XML
	  formats, along with some pre- and post-processing to manage the
	  packaging (zip / unzip), schema incompatibility processings and
	  the integration into Microsoft Office applications like Word, Excel
	  and PowerPoint. We chose to use an Open Source development model

	  HEVEA understands LaTeX macro definitions. Simple user style
	  files are understood with little or no modifications.
	  Furthermore, HEVEA customization is done by writing LaTeX code.
	  
	  HEVEA is written in Objective Caml, as many lexers. It is quite fast
	  and flexible. Using HEVEA it is possible to translate large documents
	  such as manuals, books, etc. very quickly. All documents are

	  * An XML validator.
	  * Pretty-printers for XML and HTML.
	  
	  For processing XML documents, the following components are provided:
	  
	  * Combinators is a combinator library for generic XML document processing,
	  including transformation, editing, and generation.
	  * Haskell2Xml is a replacement class for Haskell's Show/Read classes: it
	  allows you to read and write ordinary Haskell data as XML documents.
	  The DrIFT tool can automatically derive this class for you.
	  * DtdToHaskell is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD into equivalent
	  Haskell types.
	  * In conjunction with the Xml2Haskell class framework, this allows you to
	  generate, edit, and transform documents as normal typed values in programs,
	  and to read and write them as human-readable XML documents.
	  * Finally, Xtract is a grep-like tool for XML documents, loosely based on
	  the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used either from the
	  command-line, or within your own code as part of the library.

	  Abstract document tree for Perl POD documents

	  This can be used to support additional features for POD, to format output,
	  to compile into alternative formats, etc.
	  
	  WHY?
	  ====
	  
	  If you've ever asked yourself "What does Pod do for me?", this module is
	  intended to answer that question.
	  
	  While Pod looks like a simple format, the specification calls for a number
	  of special cases to be handled, and that makes any software that works on
	  Pod as text more complex than it needs to be.
	  
	  In addition to this, Pod does not lend itself to a natural structured model.
	  This makes it difficult to manipulate without damaging the validity of the
	  document.
	  
	  Pod::Abstract solves these problems by loading the document into a structured
	  tree, and providing consistent traversal, searching, manpulation and
	  re-serialisation. Pod related utilities are easy to write using Pod::Abstract.

	  thought was going to be a simple patch (mostly adding a few event

	  a rewrite due to various ideas I'd been collecting along the way.
	  Besides, I couldn't find a way to elegantly make it work with SAX2
	  without breaking the SAX1 compatibility which people are probably
	  still using. There are of course ways to do that, but most require

	  in their scripts.
	  
	  It tends to closely follow ICU APIs, so that people having experience

	  Intl consists of several modules, each of them exposes the corresponding ICU
	  API:
	  * Collator: provides string comparison capability with support
	  for appropriate locale-sensitive sort orderings.
	  * Number Formatter: allows to display number according to the
	  localized format or given pattern or set of rules, and to parse
	  strings into numbers.
	  * Message Formatter: allows to create messages incorporating
	  data (such as numbers or dates) formatted according to given
	  pattern and locale rules, and parse messages extracting data
	  from them.
	  * Normalizer: provides a function to transform text into one
	  of the Unicode normalization forms, and provides a routine to
	  test if a given string is already normalized.
	  * Locale: provides interaction with locale identifiers in the
	  form of functions to get subtags from locale identifier; parse,
	  compose, match(lookup and filter) locale identifiers.

	  PXP is a validating XML parser for O'Caml. It strictly complies to

	  The parser is simple to call, usually only one statement (function
	  call) is sufficient to parse an XML document and to represent it
	  as object tree.
	  
	  Once the document is parsed, it can be accessed using a class
	  interface. The interface allows arbitrary access including
	  transformations. One of the features of the document representation
	  is its polymorphic nature; it is simple to add custom methods to
	  the document classes. Furthermore, the parser can be configured
	  such that different XML elements are represented by objects created
	  from different classes. This is a very powerful feature, because
	  it simplifies the structure of programs processing XML documents.
	  
	  Note that the class interface does not comply to the DOM standard.
	  It was not a development goal to realize a standard API (industrial
	  developers can this much better than I); however, the API is powerful
	  enough to be considered as equivalent with DOM. More important,

	  and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.
	  
	  Although it is still under constant development, the following features are
	  already present, work fine and can be seen "in action" in the Python docs:
	  * Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help), plain text and LaTeX,
	  for printable PDF versions
	  * Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links for
	  functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
	  * Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic
	  links to siblings, parents and children
	  * Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
	  * Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
	  * Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets
	  and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings.

	  the stream of words "Sleep furiously green ideas colorless" is not a
	  valid sentence. Semantics is deeper. Even if we rearrange the above
	  sentence to be "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously", which is
	  syntactically correct, it remains nonsensical on a semantic
	  level. With Treetop, you'll be dealing with languages that are much
	  simpler than English, but these basic concepts apply. Your programs
	  will need to address both the syntax and the semantics of the
	  languages they interpret.
	  
	  Treetop equips you with powerful tools for each of these two aspects
	  of interpreter writing. You'll describe the syntax of your language
	  with a *parsing expression grammar*. From this description, Treetop
	  will generate a Ruby parser that transforms streams of characters
	  written into your language into *abstract syntax trees* representing
	  their structure. You'll then describe the semantics of your language

	  to HTML, to LaTeX, and to XSL Formatting Objects.
	  
	  It concentrates on TEI Lite, but adding support for other modules
	  is fairly easy. In the main, the setup has been used on new documents,
	  i.e. reports and web pages that have been authored from scratch,
	  rather than traditional TEI-encoded existing material.

	  the power of the zoem primitives available to them.  A prime
	  application is the creation of little mark-up languages that allow
	  easy preparation of documents for use with different devices.
	  Examples are the PUD \bf{faq} language and the PUD \bf{man} language,
	  both of which can be used to generate troff output and html
	  output. PUD stands for Portable Unix Documentation and is shipped with
	  Aephea.  Aephea itself is an abstraction layer for creating concise
	  and maintainable HTML documents.
