	  SDL library to handle the decoding of different file formats

	  SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular sound file
	  formats, such as .WAV and .MP3.  It is meant to make the programmer's sound
	  playback tasks simpler.
	  
	  The programmer gives SDL_sound a filename, or feeds it data directly from one
	  of many sources, and then reads the decoded waveform data back at her leisure.
	  
	  If resource constraints are a concern, SDL_sound can process sound data in
	  programmer-specified blocks.  Alternately, SDL_sound can decode a whole sound
	  file and hand back a single pointer to the whole waveform.  SDL_sound can also
	  handle sample rate, audio format, and channel conversion on-the-fly and
	  behind-the-scenes, if the programmer desires.

	  * flac, a command-line wrapper around libFLAC to encode and decode .flac
	  files
	  * input plugins for various music players (Winamp, XMMS, and more in the
	  works)
	  
	  "Free" means that the specification of the stream format is in the public
	  domain (the FLAC project reserves the right to set the FLAC specification
	  and certify compliance), and that neither the FLAC format nor any of the
	  implemented encoding/decoding methods are covered by any patent. It also

	  The FLAC codec is an OpenSource and Free software of very high
	  quality.  The FLAC format supports meta-info as ID3v1 tags or OGG
	  comments.  FLAC even has plugins for popular audio players such as
	  XMMS and WinAMP.  This script also helps with the generation of MP3
	  files from FLAC, whilst preserving the tags.  This way you can easily
	  convert an album from FLAC to MP3 for playing on a mobile audio
	  device.  You will need LAME installed and in your $PATH.  Using the
	  script is simple:
	  
	  * cd /path/to/directory/with/FLACS
	  * flac2mp3 *flac
	  
	  After transcoding, you will have matching, tagged MP3 files in the

	  The framework also allows you to morph to different plugins and

	help
	  

	  Libvisual is an abstraction library that comes between applications
	  and audio visualisation plugins.
	  
	  Often when it comes to audio visualisation plugins or programs that
	  create visuals, they depend on a player or something else; basically,
	  there is no general framework that enabled application developers
	  to easily access cool audio visualisation plugins. Libvisual wants
	  to change this by providing an interface towards plugins and
	  applications; through this easy to use interface applications can
	  easily access plugins and, since the drawing is done by the
	  application, it also enables the developer to draw the visual
	  anywhere he wants.
	  
	  The framework also allows you to morph to different plugins and
	  mix two at once; all kinds of neat tricks are possible using this
	  method.
	  
	  This package contains the older 0.2 release, for backward compatibility.

	  MAD (libmad) is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently
	  supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies,
	  as well as the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers
	  (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.
	  
	  MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it
	  should be backward compatible with such streams) nor does it
	  currently support AAC.
	  
	  MAD has the following special features:
	  
	  - 24-bit PCM output
	  - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
	  - completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
	  - distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
	  
	  Because MAD provides full 24-bit PCM output, applications using
	  MAD are able to produce high quality audio. Even when the output
	  device supports only 16-bit PCM, applications can use the extra
	  resolution to increase the audible dynamic range through the use
	  of dithering or noise shaping.

	  1) Supports URL style MP3 pathnames.
	  
	  2) The audio output is double-buffered. Multiple audio backends
	  such as Sun (OSS), aRts, and pcm are supported.
	  
	  3) Streams can be pre-buffered using read-ahead.
	  
	  4) Simple keyboard controls.

	  MBROLA diphone synthesizer executable

	  MBROLA is a speech synthesizer based on the concatenation of

	  of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear), at the
	  sampling frequency of the diphone database.
	  
	  It is therefore NOT a Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesizer, since it does
	  not accept raw text as input.  In order to obtain a full TTS system,
	  you need to use this synthesizer in combination with a text processing
	  system that produces phonetic and prosodic commands.
	  
	  This software is the heart of the MBROLA project, the aim of which is
	  to obtain a set a speech synthesizers for as many languages as
	  possible, free of use for non-commercial applications.
	  
	  As such, it requires an MBROLA language/voice database to run

	  Real-time graphical programming environment for audio+video

	  (Max/FTS, ISPW Max, Max/MSP, jMax, etc.) originally developed by
	  Miller Puckette and company at IRCAM. The core of Pd is written
	  and maintained by Miller Puckette and includes the work of many
	  developers, making the whole package very much a community effort.
	  
	  Pd was created to explore ideas of how to further refine the Max
	  paradigm with the core ideas of allowing data to be treated in a
	  more open-ended way and opening it up to applications outside of
	  audio and MIDI, such as graphics and video.
	  
	  It is easy to extend Pd by writing object classes ("externals") or
	  patches ("abstractions"). The work of many developers is already
	  available as part of the standard Pd packages and the Pd developer
	  community is growing rapidly. Recent developments include a system
	  of abstractions for building performance environments; a library
	  of objects for physical modeling; and a library of objects for

	  What's good (and in fact the purpose of this plugin) is that you can
	  write input plugins for XMMS in C shell or Bash! Of course, you won't
	  be able to do much number crunching in a shell script, but you can use
	  it to run other programs to do the actual playing.

	  Player for many different Amiga and PC module formats

	  platforms, including ALSA, OSS (for Linux on i386 and Alpha and FreeBSD),
	  BSD, SunOS, Solaris, S/Linux and HP-UX.  On PC class machines with GUS or
	  AWE cards xmp takes advantage of the  OSS sequencer to play modules  with
	  virtually no system load. Using software mixing, xmp plays at rates up to
	  48 kHz in mono or stereo, 8 or 16 bits, signed or unsigned, little or big
	  endian samples with 32 bit linear interpolation.
	  
	  The current version of xmp supports many Amiga and PC module formats

	  Audio player/recorder/editor for the X Window System

	  xwave is an audio player, recorder and editor for the X Window System.
	  
	  This is an alpha release of xwave.
	  
	  The user interface of xwave is based on the Athena Widget Set and some
	  Widgets from FWF. The application defaults are optimized to work with
	  Xaw3d (replaces the Xaw for 3d look), so if you don't use Xaw3d you will
	  probably need to modify the resources.
	  
	  Features:
	  - multiple files
	  - overview window
	  - zoom window
	  - mark, cut, copy, paste, merge
	  - echo, reverse, swap, resample, volume (absolute, dynamic
	  compressor)
	  - stop record on demand
	  - raw, wav, au, aiff, aifc (PCM,ALAW,ULAW,ADPCM <- not all
	  implementations)
	  - files of every length
