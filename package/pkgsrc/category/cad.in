	  and frequency-domain results such as S-parameters can also be
	  calculated. Far field radiation patterns can be obtained.
	  
	  LC is primarily an electromagnetic simulation and uses the

	  explicit solution of Maxwell's equations in three dimensions. In FD-TD,
	  the rectangular volume enclosing the model is discretized into a large

	  within the simulation space. The dielectric, permeable, lossy, and
	  conducting material properties of each cell are incorporated into the
	  field updates, which are performed iteratively in small time steps.
	  
	  An interface between the electromagnetic simulation and the circuit
	  simulation program SPICE is available within LC. This allows the user
	  to add arbitrary SPICE circuits, such as drivers and loads, into the
	  interconnect model. The interconnect performance is calculated using
	  FD-TD while the lumped-element circuits are evaluated by SPICE.

	  provide you with additional operations.  For example, Magic has
	  built-in knowledge of layout rules; as you are editing, it
	  continuously checks for rule violations.  Magic also knows about
	  connectivity and transistors, and contains a built-in hierarchical
	  circuit extractor.  Magic also has a plow operation that
	  you can use to stretch or compact cells.  Lastly, Magic has routing
	  tools that you can use to make the global interconnections in your
	  circuits.
	  
	  Magic is based on the Mead-Conway style of design.  This means that it
	  uses simplified design rules and circuit structures.  The
	  simplifications make it easier for you to design circuits and permit
	  Magic to provide powerful assistance that would not be possible
	  otherwise.  However, they result in slightly less dense circuits than

	  It is currently capable of calculating capacitances between objects -

	  equivalent circuit of stray capacitances that can be for example used
	  for more accurate circuit simulation. Alternatively it can also
	  produce field data that can be plotted for example with Gnuplot.
	  
	  Support for calculating resistances existed for a while but was later
	  removed because it didn't receive much testing.

	  MMTL programs and supporting libraries and documentation have been

	  were developed under government sponsored electronics research
	  programs in the Special Purpose Processor Development Group
	  (SPPDG). They have been employed extensively at Mayo and distributed
