	  program.
	  
	  This project started as bktr2jpeg and was (for several years) a single
	  C-source file that supported bktr-based devices only. After adding support
	  for USB webcams further features got added and the list includes now an
	  XML-based config file and a built-in mini webserver for static and streaming
	  images. There is a nice interface between the camera driver and the rest of
	  the program, so adding new devices is not hard (beside writing the driver).
	  Includes rc-scripts for NetBSD's rc.d startup and shutdown scripts.

	  of frontcards and traycards for CD's burned via an automated mechanism
	  (specifically for archiving data), but has now become popular for
	  labelling CD compilations, and copies of CDs.
	  
	  Note that cdlabelgen does not actually print anything -- it just
	  spits out postscript, which you can then do with as you please.
	  
	  cdlabelgen's purpose in life is twofold:
	  
	  1.) To be run automatically and swiftly from a shell script
	  and automatically generate a frontcard and a traycard for
	  a cd--usually data archive cd's.  The traycard (which goes
	  behind the CD itself) is U-shaped and the ends of the CD
	  case bear the label of what the CD is.
	  
	  2.) To have a minimum of dependencies -- cdlabelgen only
	  requires perl.

	  It is the most popular open source tool in the motion picture industry - used
	  in 2 Fast 2 Furious, Scooby-Doo, Harry Potter, Stuart Little and other feature
	  films. CinePaint is used for painting of background mattes and for
	  frame-by-frame retouching of movies. It is being extended to do film
	  restoration. CinePaint is available for Linux, Macintosh OS X, Windows, and
	  other popular operating systems. This software was formerly known as
	  FilmGimp.
	  
	  Animation renderers and 35mm film scanners are capable of creating greater color
	  bit-depth than can be displayed on monitors (8-bit per channel) or can be
	  manipulated in most programs. The 32-bit per channel color capacity of CinePaint
	  appeals most to cinematographers and professional still photographers. However,
	  CinePaint is a general-purpose tool useful for working on images for motion
	  pictures, print, and the Web. CinePaint supports many file formats, conventional
	  formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and TGA images -- and more exotic motion
	  picture digital intermediate formats such as Cineon and OpenEXR.
	  
	  CinePaint is free software. The generosity and commitment of its developers,

	  You tag your images which can be spread out across multiple folders,
	  and digiKam provides fast and intuitive ways to browse these tagged
	  images. You can also add comments to your images.  digiKam makes
	  use of a fast and robust database to store these meta-informations
	  which makes adding and editing of comments and tags very reliable.
	  
	  An easy-to-use interface is provided that enables you to connect
	  to your camera and preview, download and/or delete your images.
	  Basic auto-transformations can be deployed on the fly during image
	  downloading.
	  
	  Another tool, which most artists and photographers will be familiar
	  with, is a Light Table. This tool assists artists and photographers
	  with reviewing their work ensuring the highest quality only. A

	  to touch up. Well in digiKam, the light table function provides
	  the user a similar experience. You can import a photo, drag it onto
	  the light table, and touch up only the areas that need it.
	  
	  The digiKam Image Editor has its own plugin subsystem with some
	  common tools e.g. red eye correction or Gamma correction. Additional

	  can be grouped to create a so-called virtual device. Commands sent to
	  such a virtual devices will automatically issued to all attached
	  physical devices. This allows for example simultaneous output to a GIF

	  to another virtual device, allowing to construct trees of devices.
	  Virtual devices can also be useful when using different
	  user-coordinate systems. E.g. one X11 window showing an overview of a

	  Interactive geometry viewing program

	  Geomview is the product of an effort at the Geometry Center at the

	  is particularly appropriate for mathematics research and education.
	  In particular, geomview can display things in hyperbolic and spherical
	  space as well as Euclidean space.
	  
	  Geomview allows multiple independently controllable objects and
	  cameras.  It provides interactive control for motion, appearances
	  (including lighting, shading, and materials), picking on an
	  object, edge or vertex level, snapshots in SGI image file or
	  Renderman RIB format, and adding or deleting objects is provided
	  through direct mouse manipulation, control panels, and keyboard
	  shortcuts.  External programs can drive desired aspects of the
	  viewer (such as continually loading changing geometry or
	  controlling the motion of certain objects) while allowing
	  interactive control of everything else.
	  
	  Geomview supports the following simple data types: polyhedra with
	  shared vertices (.off), quadrilaterals, rectangular meshes,
	  vectors, and Bezier surface patches of arbitrary degree including
	  rational patches.  Object hierarchies can be constructed with
	  lists of objects and instances of object(s) transformed by one or
	  many 4x4 matrices.  Arbitrary portions of changing hierarchies
	  may be transmitted by creating named references.

	  - Batch mode for changing GIFs in place.
	  - Prints detailed information about GIFs, including comments.
	  - Control over interlacing, comments, looping, transparency...
	  - Creates well-behaved GIFs: removes redundant colors, only uses
	  local color tables if it absolutely has to (local color tables
	  waste space and can cause viewing artifacts), etc.
	  - It can shrink colormaps and change images to use the Web-safe
	  palette (or any colormap you choose).
	  - It can optimize your animations!  This stores only the changed
	  portion of each frame, and can radically shrink your GIFs.  You
	  can also use transparency to make them even smaller.  Gifsicle's
	  optimizer is pretty powerful, and usually reduces animations
	  to within a couple bytes of the best commercial optimizers.
	  - Unoptimizing animations, which makes them easier to edit.
	  
	  Two other programs are included with gifsicle: gifview is a lightweight

	  IJG's jpeg compression utilities

	  Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG software
	  -------------------------------------------
	  
	  This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
	  and transcoding.  JPEG is a standardized compression method for full-color
	  and gray-scale images.
	  
	  The distributed programs provide conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and
	  image files in PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, GIF, BMP, and Targa file formats.  The
	  core compression and decompression library can easily be reused in other
	  programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable C code;
	  we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.
	  
	  We are releasing this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
	  Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
	  We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
	  product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
	  We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
	  anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

config BR2_PKGSRC_PACKAGE_GRAPHICS_JPEG_LS

	help
	  

	  This software package contains an implementation of JPEG-LS, the
	  emerging lossless/near-lossless compression standard for continuous-tone
	  images being developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 (draft document
	  FCD14495 as of November 1997). The names of the executables in the
	  software package derive from the acronym LOCO, as the core of the
	  new standard is based on the LOCO-I algorithm (LOw COmplexity
	  LOssless COmpression for Images) developed at Hewlett-Packard
	  Laboratories (reference: M. Weinberger, G. Seroussi, G. Sapiro,
	  "LOCO-I: A Low Complexity, Context-Based, Lossless Image Compression
	  Algorithm," Proc. IEEE Data Compression Conference, Snowbird, Utah,
	  March-April 1996).
	  
	  The term "near-lossless compression" refers to a lossy algorithm
	  for which each decompressed image sample differs from the corresponding
	  original image sample by not more than a pre-specified value, the
	  (usually small) "loss."  Lossless compression corresponds to loss=0.
	  Even though the term "continuous-tone image" refers in principle
	  to any image whose components have more than one bit per sample,
	  palletized images may require a reordering of the color palette
	  for best compression results using LOCO-I on the array of color
	  indices. This functionality is not implemented in the present
	  software, although it is supported by the new standard, and is easy
	  enough to implement with the tools given. Notice, however, that
	  LOCO-I and JPEG-LS were not designed, and might not give optimal
	  performance, for images that have been palletized through dithering.

	  Low-loss JPEG interpolator to remove bad pixels

	  Jpegpixi is short for JPEG Pixel Interpolator. The intent of the
	  program is to interpolate pixels (single pixels, dots, stripes) in
	  JPEG images.  This is useful to correct images from a digital camera
	  with CCD defects.  For example, if one pixel is always bright green,
	  this pixel can be interpolated with jpegpixi.
	  
	  Jpegpixi is unique in that it tries to preserve the quality of the
	  JPEG image as much as possible.  Usual graphics programs decode JPEG
	  images when they are loaded, and re-encode them when they are saved,
	  which results in an overall loss of quality.  Jpegpixi, on the other
	  hand, only decodes the DCT blocks (typically 8x8, 16x8, or 16x16 pixel
	  areas) which contain pixels to be interpolated, and when it re-encodes
	  them, it uses exactly the same parameters with which the image has
	  originally been encoded.  These blocks are therefore only minimally
	  disturbed, and other blocks remain pixel-by-pixel identical to the
	  original image.

	  grayscale and color. JPEG has defined four mode of operations,
	  summarized them as follows.
	  
	  (1) Sequential encoding: each image component is encoded in a single
	  left-to-right, top-to-bottom scan;
	  (2) Progressive encoding: the image is encoded in multiple scans for
	  applications in which transmission time is long, and the viewer
	  prefers to watch the image build up in multiple coarse-to-clear
	  passes;
	  (3) Lossless encoding: the images is encoded to guarantee exact recovery
	  of every source image sample value (even though the result is low
	  compression compared to the lossy modes);
	  (4) Hierarchical encoding: the image is encoded at multiple resolutions
	  so that lower-resolution versions may be accessed without first having
	  to decompress the image at its full resolution.
	  
	  Our lossless JPEG encoding program has an automatic prediction
	  selection value (PSV) selector which selects the best PSV among a
	  user provided or default set of PSVs. This selector guarantees the
	  best compression ratio for lossless JPEG.
	  
	  The encoding program "pnmtoljpg" compresses a Portable Pixmap or
	  Portable Graymap image to a lossles JPEG (ljpg) image using the
	  JPEG standard (DIS) lossless mode of operation. The decoding program
	  "ljpgtopnm" decodes a ljpg image to either a Portable Pixmap or

	  OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
	  Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
	  
	  OpenEXR is used by ILM on all motion pictures currently in production.
	  The first movies to employ OpenEXR were Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone,
	  Men in Black II, Gangs of New York, and Signs. Since then, OpenEXR has become
	  ILM's main image file format.
	  
	  OpenEXR's features include:
	  * Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing 8- and 10-bit image
	  file formats.
	  * Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit integer
	  pixels. The 16-bit floating-point format, called "half", is compatible with
	  the half data type in NVIDIA's Cg graphics language and is supported
	  natively on their new GeForce FX and Quadro FX 3D graphics solutions.
	  * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the included codecs
	  can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film grain.
	  * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added by
	  extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution.
	  New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to
	  OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing
	  OpenEXR applications.

	  The intended use of this module is to create a web page with a bar code on it,
	  which can then be printed out and faxed or mailed to someone who will scan the
	  bar code. The application which spurred its creation was an expense report tool,
	  where the employee submitting the report would print out the web page and staple
	  the receipts to it, and the Accounts Payable clerk would scan the bar code to
	  indicate that the receipts were received.
	  
	  The default settings for this module produce a large image that can safely be
	  FAXed several times and still scanned easily. If this requirement is not
	  important you can generate smaller image using optional parameters.
	  
	  If you wish to generate images with this module you must also have the GD.pm
	  module (written by Lincoln Stein, and available from CPAN) installed.
	  
	  If the GD module is not present, you can still use the module, but you will not
	  be able to use its functions for generating images. You can use the barcode()

	  file formats.  A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned
	  data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc.
	  The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can
	  then be rendered at any resolution.
	  
	  Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS,
	  PostScript, SVG (scalable vector graphics), PGM (for easy
	  antialiasing of pixel-based images), and XFig. An experimental
	  Gimppath backend is also provided. Additional backends might be added
	  in the future.
	  
	  A separate program, mkbitmap, is also provided. This program can act

	  This library can read and write PNG files. It is written in pure Ruby for
	  maximum portability. Let me rephrase: it does NOT require RMagick or any other
	  memory leaking image library.
	  
	  == Features
	  * Decodes any image that the PNG standard allows. This includes all standard
	  color modes, all bit depths and all transparency, interlacing and
	  filtering options.
	  * Encodes images supports all color modes (true color, grayscale and indexed)
	  and transparency for all these color modes. The best color mode will be
	  chosen automatically, based on the amount of used colors.
	  * R/W access to the image's pixels.
	  * R/W access to all image metadata that is stored in chunks.
	  * Memory efficient (uses a Fixnum, i.e. 4 or 8 bytes of memory per pixel,
	  depending on the hardware)
	  * Reasonably fast for Ruby standards, by only using integer math and a highly
	  optimized saving routine.
	  * Interoperability with RMagick if you really have to.
	  
	  Also, have a look at OilyPNG at http://github.com/wvanbergen/oily_png.
	  OilyPNG is a mixin module that implements some of the ChunkyPNG algorithms
	  in C, which provides a massive speed boost to encoding and decoding.

	  C++ Standard Template Library. By writing a few adapters (image iterators
	  and accessors) you can use VIGRA's algorithms on top of your data
	  structures, within your environment. Alternatively, you can also use the
	  data structures provided within VIGRA, which can be easily adapted to a
	  wide range of applications. VIGRA's flexibility comes almost for free:
	  Since the design uses compile-time polymorphism (templates), performance
	  of the compiled program approaches that of a traditional, hand tuned,
	  inflexible, solution.
