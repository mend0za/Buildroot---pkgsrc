	  The vi editor is one of the most common text editors on Unix. It
	  was developed starting around 1976 by Bill Joy at UCB, who was
	  tired of the ed editor. But since he used ed as a code base, access
	  to the original sources has required a Unix Source Code License
	  for more than twenty years. In January 2002, Caldera was so kind
	  to remove usage restrictions to the Ancient Unix Code by a BSD-style
	  license (see the announcement at Slashdot) and thus vi is now
	  finally free.
	  
	  Compared to most of its many clones, the original vi is a rather
	  small program (~120 KB code on i386) just with its extremely powerful
	  editing interface, but lacking fancy features like multiple undo,
	  multiple screens or syntax highlighting. In other words, it is a
	  typical Unix program that does exactly what it should and nothing

	  (Smac) is also built-in to dynamically extend the editor's
	  possibilities (user functions, key bindings, modes etc). Xcoral
	  provides variable width fonts, menus, scrollbars, buttons, search,
	  regions, kill-buffers, macros and undo. An on-line manual box, with a
	  table of contents and an index, helps you to use and customize the
	  editor. Commands are accessible from menus or key bindings. Xcoral is
	  a direct Xlib client and runs on color/bw X Display.
	  
	  The example .xcoralrc is in ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/xcoral/xcoralrc.fl; copy
	  it to ~/.xcoralrc, and fire up xcoral.
