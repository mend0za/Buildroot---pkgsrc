	  BIOS VESA resolution utility for 8XX/9XX Intel chips

	  915resolution is a tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800 and 900 series
	  Intel graphics chipsets. This includes the 845G, 855G, and 865G chipsets,
	  as well as 915G, 915GM, and 945G chipsets. This modification is neccessary
	  to allow the display of certain graphics resolutions for an Xorg or XFree86
	  graphics server.
	  915resolution's modifications of the BIOS are transient. There is no risk
	  of permanent modification of the BIOS. This also means that 915resolution
	  must be run every time the computer boots in order for it's changes to
	  take effect.
	  915resolution is derived from the tool 855resolution. However, the code
	  differs substantially. 915resolution's code base is much simpler.
	  915resolution also allows the modification of bits per pixel.

	  Utility for tracking down wasted disk space

	  Suppose you're running low on disk space. You need to free some
	  up, by finding something that's a waste of space and deleting it
	  (or moving it to an archive medium). How do you find the right
	  stuff to delete, that saves you the maximum space at the cost of
	  minimum inconvenience?
	  
	  Unix provides the standard du utility, which scans your disk and
	  tells you which directories contain the largest amounts of data.
	  That can help you narrow your search to the things most worth
	  deleting.
	  
	  However, that only tells you what's big. What you really want to
	  know is what's too big. By itself, du won't let you distinguish
	  between data that's big because you're doing something that needs
	  it to be big, and data that's big because you unpacked it once and
	  forgot about it.
	  
	  Most Unix file systems, in their default mode, helpfully record
	  when a file was last accessed. Not just when it was written or
	  modified, but when it was even read. So if you generated a large
	  amount of data years ago, forgot to clean it up, and have never
	  used it since, then it ought in principle to be possible to use
	  those last-access time stamps to tell the difference between that
	  and a large amount of data you're still using regularly.
	  
	  agedu is a program which does this. It does basically the same sort
	  of disk scan as du, but it also records the last-access times of
	  everything it scans. Then it builds an index that lets it efficiently
	  generate reports giving a summary of the results for each subdirectory,
	  and then it produces those reports on demand.

	  This driver works like the standard /dev/mem driver. It just allows

	  Highly efficient file backup system based on the git packfile format

	  bup is a program that backs things up.  bup has a few advantages
	  over other backup software:
	  
	  It uses a rolling checksum algorithm (similar to rsync) to split
	  large files into chunks. The most useful result of this is you can
	  backup huge virtual machine (VM) disk images, databases, and XML
	  files incrementally, even though they're typically all in one huge
	  file, and not use tons of disk space for multiple versions.
	  
	  It uses the packfile format from git (the open source version
	  control system), so you can access the stored data even if you
	  don't like bup's user interface.
	  
	  Unlike git, it writes packfiles directly (instead of having a
	  separate garbage collection / repacking stage) so it's fast even
	  with gratuitously huge amounts of data. bup's improved index formats
	  also allow you to track far more filenames than git (millions) and
	  keep track of far more objects (hundreds or thousands of gigabytes).
	  
	  Data is "automagically" shared between incremental backups without
	  having to know which backup is based on which other one - even if
	  the backups are made from two different computers that don't even
	  know about each other. You just tell bup to back stuff up, and it
	  saves only the minimum amount of data needed.
	  
	  You can back up directly to a remote bup server, without needing
	  tons of temporary disk space on the computer being backed up.  And
	  if your backup is interrupted halfway through, the next run will
	  pick up where you left off. And it's easy to set up a bup server:
	  just install bup on any machine where you have ssh access.
	  
	  Bup can use "par2" redundancy to recover corrupted backups even if
	  your disk has undetected bad sectors.
	  
	  Even when a backup is incremental, you don't have to worry about
	  restoring the full backup, then each of the incrementals in turn;
	  an incremental backup acts as if it's a full backup, it just takes
	  less disk space.
	  
	  You can mount your bup repository as a FUSE filesystem and access
	  the content that way, and even export it over Samba.

	  delivers notification, and libfam, a library which client applications can
	  use to communicate with FAM.
	  
	  If the monitored files are mounted from a remote host, the local FAM

	  FAM can also notify its clients when a file starts and stops execution.
	  (The IRIX Interactive Desktop uses this to change a program's icon while
	  it's running, for example.)
	  
	  FAM was originally written for IRIX in 1989 by Bruce Karsh, and was

	  1558604979).
	  
	  This package is a very simple framework in which you can experiment
	  with a working (but simple) file system implementation.  The framework
	  is designed so that you can go in and modify one part of it, such as
	  how the used and free disk blocks are managed, and not have to touch
	  the rest of the file system.  And because the package creates its file
	  system inside of a normal file on your hard disk, you don't have to
	  have a spare disk or require special (root) privileges to run the
	  program.  The goal is that this package should provide a convenient
	  test bed for trying out new file system ideas without having to go
	  through the pain and difficulty of creating a real kernel based file
	  system.  The API is generic enough however that after an you debug
	  your implementation within this framework it could be moved to a real
	  kernel based file system for the BeOS or a Unix like operating system.

	  GRand Unified Bootloader -- Boots *BSD, Linux, groks ffs, FAT, ext2

	  first software program that runs when a computer starts. It is
	  responsible for loading and transferring control to the operating
	  system kernel software (such as NetBSD or Linux).  GRUB understands
	  ffs, FAT{16,32}, ext2fs, ReiserFS, minixfs, and VSTafs.  It can
	  directly boot NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux without any other
	  bootloader, loading a.out and ELF kernels from the disk and passing
	  along necessary arguments (in most cases).  It can also boot any
	  operating system (the above, plus e.g. Windows, OS/2) by chaining
	  to that operating system's specific loader.  Grub features a runtime
	  command line and loads its configuration at boot rather than
	  requiring rerunning of a separate utility.  Other features are TFTP
	  booting, serial console support, large disk support, support for
	  both DOS MBR label and BSD disklabel simultaneously, booting from
	  hard drive or floppy.
	  
	  GRUB is available for the i386 architecture only.

	  To merge information from various sources such that desktop applications can

	  information to merge varies by device and bus type. In order to do this, we
	  need to define a format for the information, hence the HAL specification.
	  
	  We may read some stuff from the hardware itself, then add some info provided
	  by the kernel, then add some metadata from some systemwide files, then add
	  some data that has been obtained by the desktop and stored per-user, then
	  look at some blacklist, and finally we have a complete picture of everything
	  known about that particular device.
	  
	  An extra value is that we can do this in an operating system independent way.
	  Stuff like this is important to the major desktop environments.

	  Create a memory stick image from NetBSD Installation CDs

	  memory stick the easy way
	  
	  I got tired of having to jump through hoops to install NetBSD on my
	  Eee PC, so I wrote a simple script to take a NetBSD release ISO and
	  convert it to an image that can be written to a USB memory stick.
	  
	  To use the script, simply feed it an ISO and tell it where to write
	  the resulting image:
	  
	  # sh mkmemstick.sh i386cd-5.0.1.iso i386memstick-5.0.1.img
	  
	  The resulting image can be written to a memory stick using dd(1):
	  
	  # dd if=i386memstick-5.0.1.img of=/dev/sd0d
	  
	  Please note that this script depends on the sysutils/cdrtools package
	  for extracting the contents of the release ISO.
	  
	  Hopefully this will be integrated with the build process so these
	  images are available for those who cannot prepare an image due to lack
	  of access to a NetBSD machine.

	  people who know about DOS-commands. And who would ask a UNIX newbie
	  to learn DOS ;-) ? This is why you need MToolsFM: It gives you a

	  For the most part, this program is used by system administrators to

	  around with the uid of restricted accounts.  One such example of this
	  is a 'www' account which is a common occurance with the proliferation
	  of the web.  While the www user's password may be starred out to

	bool "vip-19971113nb2"
	help
	  Script to edit the data at any point in a pipeline

	  Normally, in a pipeline, when you need to edit some phase of the data
	  stream, you use a standard tool such as sed, grep, or awk to alter,
	  filter, or otherwise manipulate the stream. One potential problem with
	  this approach is that the manipulations have to be very well thought out
	  in advance. Another is that the manipulations will probably need to be
	  applied uniformly. And third, the data must be very well understood in
	  advance. Not all situations and data easily conform to these
	  constraints.
	  
	  Alternatively, when the changes needed for the data are more than
	  trivial, or perhaps you just don't feel like expending the mental energy
	  needed to work out all the expressions in advance, a typical approach
	  might be to run some process or pipeline, dump output to a file, edit
	  the file with vi, pico, or emacs, then push the data along to the next
	  phase by using the file as input to some additional process or pipeline.
	  The catch here - other than the sheer awkwardness of this process - is
	  that you have to remember to come back later and clean up all of those
	  little and not-so-little "temporary" files.
	  
	  So, wouldn't you just like to be able to tap in an edit session at any
	  arbitrary point in the pipeline, do your magic on the data, then have it
	  automagically continue on its merry way? The vip program provides this
	  functionality, and operates syntactically just like any other filter.
