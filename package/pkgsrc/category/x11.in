	  Allows you to compose wallpapers for X

	  hsetroot is a tool which allows you to compose wallpapers (root pixmaps)
	  for X.  It has a lot of options like rendering gradients, solids and images
	  but it also allows you to perform manipulations on those things or chain
	  them together.  You could, for example, use one standard background image
	  together with tint to make it fit your current theme.  It is also compatible
	  with semi-translucent applications like aterm and xchat.
	  
	  At the moment, hsetroot can render: gradients (multi-color with variable
	  distance), solids (rectangles) and images (centered, tiled, fullscreen, or
	  maximum aspect).  It supports the following manipulations: tinting
	  (overlaying a color mask), blurring, sharpening, flipping (horizontally,
	  diagonally, vertically), and also allows you to adjust brightness, contrast
	  and gamma-level.  At last, it supports alpha-channels during renders.

	  Tool which helps to use mousewheels

	  This is a not so short little ditty that does the simple conversion of mouse
	  button presses into key presses.  By grabbing only the 4th and 5th mouse
	  buttons the program is able to receive input from the Intellimouse series
	  mice.  The wheel button can always be used as middle button, this program
	  does not affect how the XServer reacts towards it.  A mouse with a wheel
	  button is a 3 button mouse, and should be configured as such!
	  
	  Note that other wheeled mice such as the Logitech MouseMan+ or TrackMan+ are
	  Intellimouse compatible and can be used with this as well.  For more
	  information on setting up your wheeled mouse to work with X, see either the
	  imwheel man page or the FAQ.
	  
	  Don't forget to add "ZAxisMapping 4 5" to the Pointer Section
	  of your XF86Config file!

	  - direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
	  - proven thread support: transparently access XCB from multiple threads
	  - easy extension implementation: interfaces auto-generated from XML-XCB
	  
	  Xlib can also use XCB as a transport layer, allowing software to make

	  XCB protocol descriptions (in XML)

	  About xcb-proto
	  ===============
	  
	  The xcb-proto package provides the XML-XCB (X C Bindings) protocol
	  descriptions that libxcb uses to generate the majority of its code and API.
	  We provide them separately from libxcb to allow reuse by other projects,
	  such as additional language bindings, protocol dissectors, or
	  documentation generators.
	  
	  Separation of XCB's transport and protocol layers simplifies both
	  writing extensions and client-side support for extensions.
	  By contrast, with the xlib infrastructure, client-side support for
	  new extensions requires significant duplication of effort. With XCB and
	  the XML-XCB protocol descriptions, client-side support for a new
	  extension requires only an XML description of the extension--and not a
	  single line of code.
	  
	  Python libraries: xcb-proto also contains language-independent Python
	  libraries that are used to parse an XML description and create objects
	  used by Python code generators in individual language bindings.

	  This is a utility to tile windows on the desktop.  It supports user-
	  configurable window manager profiles to avoid screen objects and can
	  tile in a horizontal or vertical fashion.  It works well with MWM,
	  Oroborus and some multi-desktop WMs like FluxBox (given the -m option)
	  and GNOME/Metacity (given the -w option).
	  
	  It has two files controlling its behavior.  The first contains
	  "wmprofiles" that tell tile how much space to avoid on the different
	  sides of the screen (specified via "-p"). The second, named "rc",
	  contains all other configuration, including a list of XA_STRING X11
	  Atoms and values used as criteria for windows that should be avoided
	  for calculations and resize/move operations.  Both files may exist
	  under $PREFIX/share/tile/ or $HOME/.tile/.

	  tkInfo is a tk script to read GNU "info" files and display them.
	  tkInfo can be used stand alone (via WISH), or embedded within an
	  application to provide integrated, on-line help.
	  
	  Info files provide a robust hyper-text capability that is ideal for
	  on-line help.  The format is suitable for both tty-based systems and
	  graphical systems.  In addition, the same document source can produce
	  both a "nice" hardcopy manual and Info files.  Note that most GNU tools
	  are documented in this way (via texinfo).
	  
	  Info files can be created manually with any text editor, with the
	  support of the emacs "info" package, with the GNU "makeinfo" program,
	  or with the emacs scripts for latexinfo.  The makeinfo program produces
	  a set of info files from TeX source that use the GNU texinfo style (the
	  one that uses "@" everywhere).  Similarly, the latexinfo package (like
	  texinfo, but with latex commands and syntax) provides emacs scripts for
	  producing info files.

	  Since the core interface is generated automatically from the wxEiffel
	  binding, about 90% of the wxWidgets functionality is already
	  supported, excluding more "exotic" widgets like dockable windows. Most
	  work is currently directed into writing a Haskellized version of the

	  command for reuse in several subsequent tasks?  Do you ever find
	  yourself wanting some easy means of globally exporting data, e.g.
	  to a parent shell, to another xterm or application, or to another
	  machine or user?  If you answer yes to any of these questions, then
	  xcb is for you.
	  
	  Xcb provides access to the cut buffers built into every X server.
	  It allows the buffers to be manipulated either via the command line,
	  or with the mouse in a point and click manner.  The buffers can be
	  used as holding pens to store and retrieve arbitrary data fragments,
	  so any number of different pieces of data can be saved and recalled later.
	  The program is designed primarily for use with textual data.

	  About xcb-proto
	  ===============
	  
	  The xcb-proto package provides the XML-XCB (X C Bindings) protocol
	  descriptions that libxcb uses to generate the majority of its code and API.
	  We provide them separately from libxcb to allow reuse by other projects,
	  such as additional language bindings, protocol dissectors, or
	  documentation generators.
	  
	  Separation of XCB's transport and protocol layers simplifies both
	  writing extensions and client-side support for extensions.
	  By contrast, with the xlib infrastructure, client-side support for
	  new extensions requires significant duplication of effort. With XCB and
	  the XML-XCB protocol descriptions, client-side support for a new
	  extension requires only an XML description of the extension--and not a
	  single line of code.
	  
	  Python libraries: xcb-proto also contains language-independent Python
	  libraries that are used to parse an XML description and create objects
	  used by Python code generators in individual language bindings.

	  libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
	  the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.
	  
	  These libraries are currently included, roughly ordered by maturity:

	  X11 Protocol Multiplexor

	  XMX is a standalone utility for sharing an X Window System session on
	  multiple X displays.  It allows users to see and interact with the
	  same applications at the same time from different locations.  XMX
	  takes advantage of the networked nature of the X Window System by
	  acting as an intermediary between X clients and X servers.  In this
	  way, XMX works with any X clients and any X servers, without the need
	  to modify either.
	  
	  XMX provides a WYSIWIS (What You See Is What I See) environment; it
	  paints the same graphics on all participating displays.  The shared
	  client applications appear to each participant in a virtual root
	  window which is subject to local window management.  In this way, the
	  shared X session coexists with each user's private X session.
	  
	  The X client applications which are shared via XMX are unaware that
	  they are being viewed or controlled by more than one user.  Existing,
	  single-user X client applications may be shared using XMX without
	  recompilation, relinking or access to source code.
	  
	  XMX is designed as an application sharing server.  It provides both
	  the mechanism of application sharing and a way to control the shared
	  session from other programs.  Like X, it leaves policy decisions to
	  application programs.  In this way, XMX may be used as a component in
	  any of a variety of systems that require application sharing.

	  (and implementation) simple and make it useful in shell scripts.
	  
	  xp tries to be reasonably efficient in use of memory when displaying

	  in memory, by using a read-only text widget and freeing memory when a
	  file is no longer displayed (so if you go back to a previously
	  displayed file it gets re-opened).

	  stable release:

	  * Fault tolerant. All information is kept on the hard drive, not memory.
	  So if power is lost or your computer freezes, there is little lost
	  information.
	  * xpad is very customizable. The color scheme (text, background, and window
	  borders) and the font can be changed. These settings can be applied to
	  one pad or set as the default for future pads. Want window decorations or
	  not? Your choice.
	  * A customizable toolbar puts the most frequently used commands at your
	  fingertips.
	  * Support for the X session management protocol.
	  * Support for the www.freedesktop.org system tray proposal.

	  xscript is useful as part of a regression test system, as it
	  can automate the playing of fixed sequences of operations into
	  an application program based on X.  xscript can detect
	  application-program failures during playback.  To do so, it
	  detects the failure of windows to appear as necessary for
	  playback, and reports errors when windows do not appear within
	  one second of when they are expected.  A failure of a window to
	  appear is symptomatic of several classes of application failures,
	  including failure of a popup to appear and an application crash.
	  
	  Please note that xscript was written for X11R5 and therefore

	  specification.  XView features an object-oriented style Application
	  Programmer's Interface (API) that is straightforward and easy to learn.
	  
	  This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a "meta-package"
	  that depends on other XView packages.  Its sole purpose is to require
	  dependencies so users can install this package only and have all the XView
	  stuff pulled in by the port/package dependency mechanism.

	bool "xwatchwin-1.1.1nb2"
	help
	  Watch a window on another X server

	  xwatchwin allows you to peek at a window on another X server.
	  To use it, you must specify the display name of the machine you want
	  to watch, then the name of the window on that machine.
	  Xwatchwin will attempt to connect with the X server
	  hostname:0.0, and if successful, will try to retrieve a copy of
	  the window in which you specified interest.
	  
	  You may specify the window you want to watch either by name or by its
	  window id, usually a hexidecimal number.  Usually specifying the
	  window by name is simpler, although not all windows have names
	  associated with them; in that case you must use the window id option.
	  
	  If the window you want to watch is not in a viewable state,
	  xwatchwin will tell you so and exit.  If while you are watching
	  a window it becomes 'unviewable', xwatchwin will wait until the
	  window becomes 'viewable' again.
	  
	  xwatchwin was written as an aid to a class for people learning
	  to use X.  The idea is that the instructor would type into an xterm
	  window on his/her display and the students would use xwatchwin
	  to see what the instructor typed.  The students could then type the
	  same thing in their own terminal windows.  Hopefully others will find
	  equally (if not more) constructive uses.

	  For example, XWarpPointer() will move the X pointer, but no utility program
	  exists to do so on those rare occasions when you could really use it.  xwit
