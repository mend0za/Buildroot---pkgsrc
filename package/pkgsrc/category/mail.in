	  Bayesian spam filter written in C

	  Bogofilter is a mail filter that classifies mail as spam or ham
	  (non-spam) by a statistical analysis of the message's header and
	  content (body).  It is able to learn from the user's classifications
	  and corrections.
	  
	  The statistical technique is known as the Bayesian technique and
	  its use for spam was first described by Paul Graham in his article
	  A Plan For Spam.  Gary Robinson, in his weblog Rants, suggests some
	  refinements for improved discrimination between spam and ham.
	  Bogofilter's primary algorithm uses the f(w) parameter and the
	  Fisher inverse chi-square technique that he describes.
	  
	  Bogofilter is run by an MDA script to classify an incoming message
	  as spam or ham (using wordlists stored by BerkeleyDB).  Bogofilter
	  provides processing for plain text and HTML.  It supports multi-part
	  mime message with decoding of base64, quoted-printable, and

	  addresses (one address per line) and a message (with headers already
	  attached) to be sent to the recipients.  It sorts the recipient
	  list by reversed domain (so similar ones sort together), splits up
	  the recipients into several groups containing no more than N domains
	  each, creates an SMTP envelope for each group of recipients, and
	  feeds that envelope to "/usr/lib/sendmail -bs".
	  
	  Splitting the envelopes up allows sendmail to perform delivery in
	  parallel, so instead of having one large queue entry (for which
	  sendmail might take awhile to get around to attempting delivery
	  for some recipients), it has several smaller queue entries.
	  Depending on your point-of-view, this can still be considered
	  "cluttering up your mail queue", but it does seem to deliver messages
	  more quickly to most recipients.

	  IMAP server for access to maildir-style mailboxes

	  Courier-IMAP is a server that provides IMAP access to maildirs. This
	  IMAP server does NOT handle traditional mailbox files (/var/spool/mail,
	  and derivatives), it was written for the specific purpose of providing
	  IMAP access to maildirs.
	  
	  "Maildir" is a directory-based mail storage format originally introduced
	  in the Qmail mail server, and adopted as an alternative mail storage
	  format by both Exim and Postfix.  Courier-IMAP is popular on
	  Qmail/Exim/Postfix sites that are configured to use maildirs.  The
	  primary advantage of maildirs is that multiple applications can access
	  the same maildir simultaneously without requiring any kind of locking
	  whatsoever.  It is a faster and more efficient way to store mail.  It
	  works particularly well over NFS, which has a long history of
	  locking-related woes.
	  
	  This package differs from a vanilla Courier-IMAP installation in that
	  the files are installed at locations that more closely correspond to
	  a Courier installation.

	  MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite can be used as database backends.
	  
	  DBMail is made up of several components. A normal MTA (Postfix,
	  SendMail, QMail, Exim) is used for accepting messages. The MTA
	  hands the messages over to dbmail-smtp, using a pipe interface, or
	  dbmail-lmtpd, using LMTP (Local Mail Transport Protocol). These
	  programs take care of delivering the message into the database.
	  Messages can be retrieved from the database using dbmail-pop3d,
	  using the POP3 protocol, and dbmail-imapd, using the IMAP4Rev1
	  protocol.
	  
	  The whole email is stored in the database. That includes attachments.
	  The DBMail programs do not have to touch the filesystem to retrieve
	  or insert emails. User information is also stored in the database,
	  so users do not need an account on the machines DBMail is running

	  The output of a script is a list of mail addresses, files and programs

	  automatically in prearranged ways (e.g. encryption and decryption,
	  tossing junk mail, or vacation notices).

	  (RFC 5804) to the Dovecot Secure IMAP Server.
	  
	  The Sieve language is used to specify how e-mail needs to be processed. By
	  writing Sieve scripts, users can customize how messages are delivered, e.g.
	  whether they are forwarded or stored in special folders. Unwanted messages can
	  be discarded or rejected, and, when the user is not available, the Sieve
	  interpreter can send an automated reply. Above all, the Sieve language is meant
	  to be simple, extensible and system independent. And, unlike most other mail
	  filtering script languages, it does not allow users to execute arbitrary
	  programs. This is particularly useful to prevent virtual users from having full
	  access to the mail store. The intention of the language is to make it impossible
	  for users to do anything more complex (and dangerous) than write simple mail
	  filters.
	  
	  Using the ManageSieve protocol, users can upload their Sieve scripts remotely,
	  without needing direct filesystem access through FTP or SCP. Additionally,
	  aManageSieve server always makes sure that uploaded scripts are valid,
	  preventing compile failures at mail delivery.
	  
	  This package provides Sieve support as a plugin to Dovecot's Local Delivery
	  Agent (LDA) and Dovecot's LMTP service. The ManageSieve protocol is provided is
	  an additional service, next to Dovecot's own POP3 and IMAP services.

	  exmh is a TCL/TK based interface to the MH mail system.
	  
	  IMPORTANT: exmh depends on the TK send facility for its background
	  processing.  With TK 3.3, send now uses xauthority mechanisms by default,
	  unless you compile TK with -DTK_NO_SECURITY.  Generally, this means that
	  you **MUST** must run xdm to start your Xserver.
	  
	  FEATURES: As well as providing the usual layer on top of MH commands, exmh
	  has a number of other features:
	  
	  MIME support!  Displays richtext and enriched directly.
	  Color feedback in the scan listing.
	  A colour coded folder display with one label per folder.
	  Smart scan caching.  News read/post.  koi8-r support.
	  Facesaver bitmap display.  Ispell support.
	  Background inc.  You can set exmh to run inc periodically.
	  Searching over folder listing and message body.
	  A dialog-box interface to MH pick.
	  A editor editor with emacs-like bindings with MIME support.
	  Glimpse interface.  You can index all your mail with glimpse
	  and search for messages by content.
	  User preferences.  You can tune exmh through a dialog box.
	  User hacking support.  A user library of TCL routines is supported.

	  Easy-to-use, high-speed mailing list manager for qmail

	  ezmlm is an easy-to-use, high-speed mailing list manager for qmail.
	  
	  ezmlm lets users set up their own mailing lists within qmail's address
	  hierarchy. A user, Joe, types
	  
	  ezmlm-make ~/SOS ~/.qmail-sos joe-sos isp.net
	  
	  and instantly has a functioning mailing list, joe-sos@isp.net, with all
	  relevant information stored in a new ~/SOS directory.
	  
	  ezmlm takes advantage of qmail's VERPs to reliably determine the
	  recipient address and message number for every incoming bounce message.
	  
	  ezmlm is reliable, even in the face of system crashes. It writes each
	  new subscription and each new message safely to disk before it reports
	  success to qmail.
	  
	  ezmlm doesn't mind huge mailing lists. Lists don't even have to fit into
	  memory. ezmlm hashes the subscription list into a set of independent
	  files so that it can handle subscription requests quickly. ezmlm uses
	  qmail for blazingly fast parallel SMTP deliveries.

	  and MIME support and more. In addition, improved bounce handling,

	  yet light-weight and fast language, which makes it easier to build and test
	  more elaborated filters and training methods.
	  
	  The OSBF algorithm is a typical Bayesian classifier but enhanced with two
	  techniques originally developed for the CRM114 project: Orthogonal Sparse
	  Bigrams - OSB, for feature extraction, and Exponential Differential Document
	  Count - EDDC (a.k.a Confidence Factor), for automatic feature selection.
	  Combined, these two techniques produce a highly accurate classifier. OSBF
	  was developed focused on two classes, SPAM and NON-SPAM, so the performance
	  for more than two classes may not be the same.
	  
	  spamfilter.lua is an anti-spam filter written in Lua using the OSBF-lua
	  module.  It takes special advantage of EDDC to introduce TONE-HR, a highly
	  effective training method. The combination of OSB, EDDC and TONE-HR to
	  enhance a classical Bayesian classifier resulted in the best spam filtering

	  set of commands or data-limited responses.  If the server says it, the

	  Tools for passing mail across serial links

	  serialmail is a collection of tools for passing mail across serial
	  links. It works with qmail: you use qmail to deliver messages to
	  a maildir, and then serialmail to deliver messages out of the
	  maildir.
	  
	  serialmail is designed to handle three common types of mail delivery
	  between a dialup computer and an ISP:
	  
	  * Delivery to the ISP. The dialup computer sends all outgoing mail
	  to the ISP.
	  
	  * AutoTURN delivery from the ISP. After the dialup computer makes
	  an SMTP connection to the ISP, it automatically receives an
	  SMTP connection back from the ISP if there is any new mail for
	  it. This provides the same power as ETRN but does not require
	  a special client.
	  
	  * User-controlled delivery from the ISP. A user with a shell account
	  can switch from qmail-pop3d to serialmail without pestering the
	  sysadmin. The user can also decide whether undeliverable messages
	  should be left for POP retrieval or bounced back to the sender.

	  improves required time to complete delivery of copies of a message to
	  recipients of huge number.
	  
	  This delay of delivery by sendmail causes by the fact that implementation
	  of SMTP delivery routine in sendmail processes all delivery in a series.
	  By this reason,  when it takes long time for delivery to one recipient
	  which is in a huge list, delivery to following recipients is greatly
	  influenced.
	  
	  To avoid such a problem, delivery agents should be implemented so that
	  a delivery is not influenced by preceding delivery: DNS query and
	  SMTP delivery par destination should be processed in parallel.
	  Smtpfeed is the SMTP delivery agent for sendmail implemented with this

	  Mail filter to identify spam

	  SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It will examine
	  each message presented to it, and assign a score indicating the
	  likelihood that the mail is spam.
	  
	  It applies a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers and body text
	  to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited commercial email. The mail
	  can then be optionally tagged as spam for later filtering.
	  
	  The spam-identification tactics used include header analysis, text analysis,
	  a Bayesian-style form of probability-analysis classification and DNS
	  blacklists. It also includes plugins to support reporting spam messages to
	  collaborative filtering databases such as Pyzor, DCC, and Vipul's Razor.
	  
	  The distribution provides a command line tool to perform filtering, along
	  with a set of perl modules which allows SpamAssassin to be used in a
	  variety of different spam-blocking scenarios.
	  
	  In addition, "spamd", a daemonized version of SpamAssassin which runs
	  persistently, is available. Using its counterpart, "spamc", a lightweight
	  client written in C, an MTA can process large volumes of mail through
	  SpamAssassin without having to fork/exec a perl interpreter for each message.
	  
	  SpamAssassin does not deliver mail to the users mailbox. You need a

	  OpenBSD spam deferral daemon

	  Tarpits like spamd are fake SMTP servers, which accept connections but don't
	  deliver mail. Instead, they keep the connections open and reply very slowly.
	  If the peer is patient enough to actually complete the SMTP dialogue (which
	  will take ten minutes or more), the tarpit returns a 'temporary error' code
	  (4xx), which indicates that the mail could not be delivered successfully and
	  that the sender should keep the mail in his queue and retry again later.
	  If the spammer does, the same procedure repeats. Until, after several attempts,
	  wasting both his queue space and socket handles for several days, the spammer
	  gives up. The resources the spamd server has to waste to do this are minimal.
	  
	  If the sender is badly configured, an uncooperative recipient might actually
	  delay his entire queue handling for several minutes each time he connects to
	  the tarpit. And many spammers use badly configured open relays.

	  best of both worlds.
	  
	  spamdyke can optionally reject the connection if the remote server's

	  Enhanced xbiff, with pixmap and sound support

	  The xmailbox program started out as an enhanced xbiff. However, the latest
	  version includes support for sound effects and animation. The default
	  functionality employs two images for the "mail in mailbox" and "no mail"
	  states, in the form of XPM type 3 files. The default images are, respectively,
	  that of an empty mailbox with its flag down, and that of an open mailbox,
	  with its flag up and a letter visible inside. Animation can be enabled for
	  playing up to 8 XPM files in repeated sequence.
	  
	  The application can also, optionally, play a sound through a workstation's
	  audio device, instead of generating the default beep sound, whenever new
	  mail arrives.
	  
	  By default, pressing any mouse button in the image forces xmailbox to
	  remember the current size of the mail file as being the "empty" size and
	  to change its image accordingly. In addition to this, the user can
	  optionally have xmailbox invoke his/her favourite mail retrieving program.
