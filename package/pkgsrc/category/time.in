	  Oracle has flexible date formatting via its NLS_DATE_FORMAT session

	  current setting of NLS_DATE_FORMAT.
	  
	  Timestamp values will match either the NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT or
	  NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT session variables.

	  examining environment variables of the same name. Each time one of
	  Oracle's formatting session variables is updated, the %ENV hash must
	  also be updated.

	bool "p5-DateTime-Precise-1.05nb3"

	  Perl module for common time and date operations with GPS ops

	  The purpose of this library was to replace our dependence on Unix
	  epoch time, which, being limited to a range of about 1970 to 2030,
	  is inadequate for our purposes (we have data as old as 1870). This
	  date library effectively handles dates from A.D. 1000 to infinity,
	  and would probably work all the way back to 0 (ignoring, of course,
	  the switch-over to the Gregorian calendar). The useful features of
	  Unix epoch time (ease of date difference calculation and date
	  comparison, strict ordering) are preserved, and elements such as
	  human-legibility are added. The library handles fractional seconds
	  and some date/time manipulations used for the Global Positioning
	  Satellite system.
	  
	  The operators +/-, <=>, cmp, stringify are overloaded. Addition
	  handles seconds and fractions of seconds, subtraction handles
	  seconds or date differences, compares work, and stringification
	  returns the a representation of the date.
	  
	  The US Geological Survey (USGS) likes midnight to be 24:00:00 of
	  the previous day, not 00:00:00 of the day people expect. If
	  $DateTime::Precise::USGSMidnight is set, dprintf will always print
	  midnight as 24:00:00 and the date returned from dprintf will have
	  the previous day's date. Regardless, time is always stored internally
	  as 00:00:00.

	  Perl module for date/time sets and ranges

	  DateTime::Set is a module for date/time sets.  It can be used to handle two
	  different types of sets.
	  
	  The first is a fixed set of predefined datetime objects.  For example, if we
	  wanted to create a set of dates containing the birthdays of people in our
	  family.
	  
	  The second type of set that it can handle is one based on the idea of a
	  recurrence, such as "every Wednesday", or "noon on the 15th day of every
	  month".  This type of set can have fixed starting and ending datetimes, but
	  neither is required.  So our "every Wednesday set" could be "every Wednesday
	  from the beginning of time until the end of time", or "every Wednesday after
	  2003-03-05 until the end of time", or "every Wednesday between 2003-03-05 and

	  time zone defined.  This allows for various optimizations in doing
	  time zone calculations.  This conversion is done with the script in

	  The Olson time zone database is the best available source for world
	  wide time zone information.  It is available from

	  listed and edited. Appointments are entered with the following information:
	  
	  - the date, time, and length (time and days) of the appointment,
	  - an optional text message and an optional script to be executed,
	  - early-warn and late-warn triggers that precede the alarm time

	  can be configured to display times in 12-hour or 24-hour formats, mmddyy and
	  ddmmyy date formats, and can show either Monday or Sunday in the leftmost
	  column. Four view modes are supported: month, year, week, day, and a 365-day

	  algorithm -- you also need some special data for each and every
	  location for which you want to predict tides.  XTide reads this data
	  from harmonics files.  Ultimately, XTide's predictions can only be as
	  good as the available harmonics data.  Due to issues of data
	  availability and of compatibility with non-U.S.  tide systems, the
	  predictions for U.S.  locations tend to be a lot better on average
	  than those for locations outside of the U.S.
	  * Deviations of 1 minute from official predictions are typical for U.S.
	  locations having the latest data.
	  * Deviations of 20 minutes are typical for non-U.S. locations or U.S.
	  locations that are using obsolete data.
	  * Much longer deviations indicate a problem.
